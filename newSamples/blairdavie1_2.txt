Kyle's house smells like home and I love that boy.  @kylefummey marry me x
That was one of my favourite Stop The Rain gigs so far. Big love to everyone who came down and sang along with us x
@grgratlntc @stoptherainuk You love it
@Ben_muiir @Leah_hamill @NiallOfficial Ben you're on slippery ground dude https://t.co/Ni4XWEnXc0
@Ben_muiir @NiallOfficial If Harry Styles had said it then fair enough. But nah
@georgia_bayne @Ben_muiir Never.
@kylefummey @georgia_bayne @Ben_muiir Do explain?
@georgia_bayne @Ben_muiir Nah nah the pole is inaccurate. If you had specified 'early Taylor Swift' then there we would be no comparison.
It's late and I'm tired but teardrops on my guitar by Taylor Swift is such a timeless song
@georgia_bayne Not a fan, sorry
@georgia_bayne Meh
@grgratlntc 💔💔💔
@kylefummey @grgratlntc Yeah just kick me while I'm down, thanks Kyle x
