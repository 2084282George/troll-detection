Got through my very first care inspectorate and HMIE inspection this week so I'm making him take me out for tea  to celebrate 😂 @mudie97
Putting a sun bed shop right next door to my gym is the best decision that perths ever made tbh.
I'm in a, "fuck it have a like" mood.
Don't even use Snapchat any more cause the new layout is that bad.
Love of my life. https://t.co/u6mRqY7NKf
Two for Tuesdays.
Back to work fear has kicked in
@Tahylss The one in Perth babe don't freak out 😂. The Ines in Dundee are still up and running as far as I know 😂
Been battering on about a Chinese buffet for days and jordans finally given in and promised to take me today... onl… https://t.co/whOgWo5WHy
Jordan followed me in and out of every shop in Aberdeen today, carried all my bags and didn't complain once ♥️ #keeper
See if a text starts with "okay don't be mad but..." I feel like I'm about to be mad 🙄
To the girl walking about Perth wearing sliders and socks. STOP.
I actually have no idea how this even happens https://t.co/NOcRXalxiN
Trying to explain 50 shades to jordan is like trying to explain to a cavemans how iPhones work. The boy is clueless… https://t.co/feBKNi7CyD
Ladies get yourself a man who supports everything you do, no matter what ❤️❤️❤️🙌🏻 https://t.co/W7Y7Ywobtr

@mudie97  1 more day 😘 https://t.co/rEMVAo2qXg
I mean we all knew he wasn't gonna win but no one was prepared for him to leave tonight 💔🍰
@paulkdouglas you are to blame https://t.co/3rWGjYfZT2
Me and Jordan just high fived cause we finished a munchie box.
Promised Jordan I wouldn't nap till he finished work so that we could nap together but Im confident my eyes won't hold out till 3😫😴
@Tahylss @velvetgh0st Raging at this. I'd love to be telling people my best mates name is margherita
Group of guys in H&amp;M today tryin to figure out how a hair bun works. One lad said it seems like so much effort being a girl. It is hun😩🙌🏻
Actual how I feel rn. C'meer 😤 https://t.co/AlKs1Poiid
@mudie97  🖕🏼
Heating up at Grannies tonight
Long weekend for meeee🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Finding someone that you can sit all day and just laugh with is the best feeling.
My manager at work always tries to turn any situation into a positive. Regardless of what she's faced with. That's leadership 🙌🏻
Just slept right through my Saturday
Late night shopping on a Thursday is still a thing right...
Pasta prosecco and sorbet. That's how Friday's should be spent. 🍝🍾🍨
Can't stop thinking about falling asleep in the garden later and hopefully waking up refreshed and broon
Not been on Facebook once today and I've been so happy.
Transmit actually looked half decent. Definitely something to consider next year 🍻
Whatever happened to easy Friday's 😶. Roll on half 5 so that I can see my favourite people😍. Celebrations for my girls birthday @Tahylss🥂
@mudie97 You're an ass
Stunned tht an hour ago I was in be d with a glass of wine watching breakfast at Tiffanys. Currently being dragged to Dundee for a night out
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/xgYEv7IscV
I've only just now sat down and can be bothered to create my own bitmoji and now I can't stop playing with it 💃🏼
Was so good to meet you last night @ScottReid93 
Can't wait to see you perform tonight! #CuriousIncident… https://t.co/ztEBqmG7H9
Prosecco Sundays are lethal
How hot is Dec
I am only 2000 words away from completing this god forsaken class and I have no motivation at all 😩😩
@paulkdouglas @Tahylss And we're the three best friends that anyone could have
People can be so ungrateful✋🏼.
Anyone else unable to just watch 1 BGT audition on YouTube? I end up clicking on countless videos til I get to "BGT best bits 2008"
No way did my dad just hand Donna a bit of birthday cake and say "don't eat it all at once mind, you might get fat" 😂😂 savage
Wow. Difficult night 💭
Going up to Aberdeen this weekend to see one of my favourite people 😁😁!! https://t.co/xps9iNKTrh
Nothing more satisfying than finishing a report that you've done nothing but stress out over for the past month. 👩🏼‍🏫
@Arlene_Barnes 🙌🏻👳🏾‍♀️🔥
His grammar is outstandingly bad. 😂😂 https://t.co/HWFipAYP2N
5 mile run before bed. Shower #3 please 😰🏃🏼‍♀️
@chloe__campbell 🔥🔥👌🏻
So buzzing for my day off tomorrow. I'm just gonna binge watch 13 reasons why all day until I cry.
I'm two episodes away from finishing sex and the city and I can't even bare it.
Spoons is always a good idea until you need to go to the toilet. 7 flights of stairs and an SOS call later  😰😰
Had such an amazing week away but words can't describe how happy I am to be in my own bed watching sex and the city✌🏼
My reaction when anyone says they actually like the taste of tonic water. https://t.co/blx4Y4N485
Getting to a shopping centre early before the shops open remind me of when I used to work at Warren James 😖 #haunted #retailnightmares
Eh how do you loose a stone in 3 days... 🙄☀️👙
Phoning my insurance company to report someone battering into the back of my car is the most adult think I've ever done. #Grass #adultlife
Really struggling to accept Scarlett Moffat's eyebrows rn.
