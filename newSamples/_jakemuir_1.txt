@truthiscolor Haha! I can do that ;)
@kiernanlaveaux yeah just came out! https://t.co/Oyee2bjizN
@patrickbalthrop You are the best &lt;3
@actual_anna lol, it's good stuff. I've always enjoyed Level-5's games: Rogue Galaxy, Dark Cloud 2, DQ8, etc.
@actual_anna Ni No Kuni is the shit. Was the last game I bought and played all the way through. Can't believe it's been almost 5 years :O.
@dalecornish Pretty special album. He was one of the most unique voices in electronic music, imo. Also the only dud‚Ä¶ https://t.co/vWJFYG4PjM

@glorbis @d_hansen @lexciya_ Your BUTW mix counts, haha. Not talking releases specifically.
@d_hansen Plus you, @glorbis @lexciya_ , maybe a few others in aware of.
I think my main hope for art in 2018 is to see more queers working in the abstract music realm. We could use a lot more.

@closing_remarks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think the longest I'll let something run without some sort of alteration is 30 secs or so.
@glorbis Quite useful; I blow my nose with them when I'm in the car, haha.
@closing_remarks Morph into a new part, some sort of gradual modulation of existing elements, introduction of new layers, etc.
@NormChambers üòè
@lexciya_ So envious! No west coast dates :(

Surely this has to be one of the most mental 12"s out there... https://t.co/iouMVZp2w0
@HE_VALENCIA For sure. They were inspired by the Tim Burton films. Was more of an all ages thing...
@HE_VALENCIA üôåüí• so good, even the films.
@oootini Yeah I've been trying to play with reverse more often. I usually forget about it...
@oootini You should ;). So much timbral variety, beyond the fun of just re-contextualizing the source.
@sheatheman Haha! Press release for this. Should be up your alley, if I didn't already show it to you awhile ago. https://t.co/9rPlwzvltf
