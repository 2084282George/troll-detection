My personality is something like when a lightning bolt hits a rainbow
I'd rather be alone than be with someone else.
With saying goodbye to what you love comes pain
Rainy days and black umbrellas ✖
Sometimes I try to write and I go about how I feel. The page is completely empty and that explains it perfectly
When the days over, just don't forget me.
Time flies by, my life is constantly changing and I don't know where I will be 5 or 10 years from now.
