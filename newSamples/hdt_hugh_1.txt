@MrBrownsEtc @LDLDN @RadioDEBONAIR I didn’t see any begging in the station it was an announcement over the intercom
@ItoaMusic This is it, I guess any “don’t give money to beggars” announce is abhorrent no matter how it’s worded
Announcer at Whitechapel referred to beggars as “these people”. Sounded well gross, or am I just too much of a sjw… https://t.co/3RfdyOTX9r

@AshersBarker @Josefsinclair Cap also p likely, anyone with 3 solo films already should be watching their back
@AshersBarker Agreed, put the poor bastard out of his misery. Also: Drax, maybe Dr Strange
Lemsip, my don
@ItoaMusic To confirm: the Sin City character, because he wears his hood with his ears poking out.

About a week ago on fb I saw a video of a dude on a bus with a really extreme nit problem and my head still hasn’t stopped phantom itching
@ItoaMusic @mina_um_so which we all know is pretty much the best you’re gonna get
@ItoaMusic @Rob_Rua At least take your headphones out!!
Man not one to hype 2018 too much but a Black Star album produced by @madlib is one of the most exciting things I could have hoped for
@joemuggs Couldn’t agree more, what’s he supposed to do, spit at any Tories he interviews?
@mina_um_so Now that I can agree with 🤖 💦
@mina_um_so once told me he was her sexiest crew member and I haven’t trusted her since

@andrewryce @_emilyglass I don’t know what I was expecting but I didn’t expect it to give me that much of a belly laugh that’s for sure
@AshersBarker It was Doctor strange in the new trailer what did it
@ofblacklanterns In my mind it’s going to be 30 minutes Thanos exposition and 2 hours airport scene tho, let a boy dream.
@andrewryce @tony_poland A NEW CONTENDER ENTERS
Gonna capitalise on jet lag by becoming a 7.30-4.30 guy rather than 10:30-7:30 wish me luck
@posthuman Also much better than raves, which are currently struggling away at the bottom of  my top ten activities
I’m at a stage in my life where I like memes about raves more than the raves themselves
At the ripe old age of 30 I have finally decided I actually kinda like Muse
