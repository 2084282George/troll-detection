Corbyn is the most genuine politician I think I've ever seen. He stands for whats right for the people. Stuns me how other people disagree.

@GCaltabanis @Matt_Santangelo that's true, Valencia is one of the best RBs in the league. However he has played LB a few times this year
@GCaltabanis @Matt_Santangelo it's frustrating watching him play he's quite poor. If some one cuts in from the left he can't handle it
@Izublingz64 might know something you would find beneficial
This year is going really quick, half way through March already üò≥
Who's better?
What the biggest challenge for Journalists?
RVP is like the managers son, that plays shit every game but still starts, LVG needs to realise he's not the player he once was

The thing that annoys me the most is that Pogba is exactly what we need, and we were too stupid to realise what he was at the time.
Normally it's our defence that gets blames but today the attackers have let us down. Not a single shot on target.
We can turn this around COME ON UNITED

Although Van Gaals start has been worse than Moyes' start, it's a different story because we are actually playing some good football.
Proud of United unlucky not to get a point and we was down to 10 men. City aren't anything special.
