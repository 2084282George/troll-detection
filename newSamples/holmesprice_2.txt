@HBFblog Mine has completely changed. Hardly any pages, all people and groups. Really repetitive
@cnmcgoo And many, many others
at least when it was all pages there was some kind of curation. now it’s just a second twitter, that’s much less entertaining
still looking for some new live acts for some shows across the year – reccs pls 🙌🏼
