I think we were all far too happy on Christmas morning and 2016 decided we needed to remember our place.
Wakes up. Drinks coffee. Goes back to sleep.
The one time I don't wear make up on the train back home and there's a damn film crew shooting for a channel 5 documentary on board.
Maybe the key to success is wording my entire CV like one massive clickbait article.
I go to look up one of the actors in HTGAWM and I get MAJOR SEASON 3 SPOILERS.

I'M SO MAD.

2016 JUST KEEPS ON SWINGING.
@SoFairIsShe New plan. I'm writing you a musical with hologram Liam Neeson in.
There's no escaping the relentless Christmas spirit of @rjackz https://t.co/8E6u3z4bdl
I'm sorry Real World. I can't hear you over the sound of this all you can drink tequila bar.

@DexterJManning @FF_XIV_EN Oh trust me I'm all over this üòçüòçüòç She's so beautiful I can wait for her to destroy me.
One of the worst things about being sick is actually looking sick. Been avoiding mirrors like the plague, ironically.
@SoFairIsShe I had to.
@SoFairIsShe Not at all I'm flattered. You flirt üëÑ
@SoFairIsShe Hi
Bought a new journal. Already wrote things in the wrong dates. This is why I'm the most disorganised person I know.
I suppose it could be worse than being paid with 250 Lotus Biscuits.
@Mipsyspindle Some of my personal favourites include: Wheelspin, Medium Rare, Dudebro2000, FACE PUNCHER, Kenneth, Zhwoozsh and Small Amoeba.
My hair is currently a high fashion reverse mullet.

@MissMousieMouse I LOVE THIS DRESS&lt;3
Woken up by maintenance from a dream where I bought 6 baby rabbits and three beehives. Fix my shattered dreams while you're at it mate.
Did you ever notice that sometimes words just sound like noise but other times noise makes the prettiest sound? #sworcery
@MissMousieMouse I'll send pictures once I'm done! üêù
@MissMousieMouse Happens to the beat of us! Check out this bee print fat quarter I got for no reason at all! https://t.co/v4fMrF4wrF

Get this.  Pizza... But with halloumi instead of mozerella.
@Mipsyspindle Really makes me wish I could get this game just to hear it in its intended context.

As if there was a Growlithe waiting for me outside work. Only for the game to crash just as he popped up.
@SoFairIsShe Or one of those pencil cases that look like realistic fish.
@Mipsyspindle Innocent people shouldn't have to suffer just for being in the wrong place when the wrong people decide it's time.
@Mipsyspindle My thoughts are with anyone who has been remotely affected by any of the horrendous recent events.
Good morning everyone I'm having mini-donuts for breakfast.
@DexterJManning @FF_XIV_EN Oh my god finally

So buzzing to go on holiday tomorrow it's honestly like Christmas eve but in June!! ‚úà
@Mipsyspindle But here's hoping that we future generations can figure this out. The results show that most of us aren't entirely insane.
Lay on your back and the world becomes your rucksack.
