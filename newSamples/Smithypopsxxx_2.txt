When Jade is teaching these grown ass men pretending to be 15 algebra and uses football to teach them what 9 divided by 3 is
Life drawing is the highlight of my week
A million dreams is all it's gonna take 🖤
He's still my James Bae tho 🖤
New songs, new hair #JamesBae 😭😍
@DarrenHardie Surely it's not a surprise to anyone, like surely
@Capn_Kidd Looked like it! Also ❤ing the cover art
@jxsssmith rude af
Does anyone genuinely enjoy Shreddies?
Jess has started watching Black Mirror and I'm honestly so proud of that lil bean
I mean, I still want to sleep but at least they've made the switch to Sean Paul
Hoping for another @AmberRun album or tour this year plz
@DarrenHardie Living our best lives 😭😭😭
Last night I dreamt that I had a lil baby pig as a pet but now I woke up without one and I'm distraught
Removed from the library at 2am on the first day back #happyrefreshersweek
@Capn_Kidd If you're releasing a new EP plz let there be a way for one to make its way to Scotland again, I serious… https://t.co/mdm1cRZJnq
Just found out @Capn_Kidd have some new songs out and I'm hyped
I'll never let her forget the time she changed Buble to Smashmouth while I was in the shower and couldn't change it… https://t.co/n3Rh3PaMJN
Danny Devito is miraculous
Charlie Brooker needs a sit down and a cup of tea with a chocolate biscuit
Crocodile has me absolutely floored. Just like after Shut Up and Dance  last season I'm going to need a break now... #BlackMirror
Need to resist the urge to spend today watching all of the new Black Mirrors
Maybe if I tweet that I'm getting up at 6 and going to the gym, then I'll feel socially obliged to do so and might actually go?
@jxsssmith @TVsPointless Ehhh no he was still written by Roger Hargreaves so not a spin off and officially a Mr Men
Absolutely cheated tonight.
@TVsPointless has caused a serious rift in our family. https://t.co/uVtwI2PhPa
Ehhh, @richardosman can you explain this? https://t.co/yTt7bqGXuJ
@chaxmase I think the guy sitting next to him's girlfriend might have something to say about that xo
I would also do everything in three's to make sure Charlie doesn't die xo
Professional Masterchef this year is outstanding
22 going on 80
My hip feels dislocated
If we dont get Stitches coming to visit then what's the point of Pocket Camp?
Life drawing on a Tuesday is becoming the highlight of my week 🎨🖤
I'm a big ol' https://t.co/5f9nKFgtXG
Steven from Masterchef is the cutest. He's the cooking world's Samwell Tarly 🖤
I had the loveliest weekend with my even lovelier folks ❤
@DarrenHardie Never 2 early tho
@amyfm95 The happiest of days 🌟❤
The Buble cover of Always on my Mind makes my heart melt, honestly
Imagine being famous and being able to send gifs of yourself, how mad is that
