The best part of managing a coffee shop is the access you have to industry samples. Free coffee, pastries, bread and all sorts 🙌🏾

@jamaicawest312 @JohnCPendleton 😂 the R.I.P come Monday night
@JohnCPendleton @jamaicawest312 Yes. It’s hard being an introvert and realising most conversations stay in my head 🤦🏾‍♀️

@WhatIsJoeDoing @JohnCPendleton 😂
A sure sign I'm over caffeinated and acting strange is my willingness and sometimes eagerness to talk to strangers.
@cieraasmith Not the life you should be living. Repent and be baptised.
How can you entertain the possibility of freedom when you refuse to acknowledge the bondage you are under.

@SheTooCold @monet_iam They were a hot mess
