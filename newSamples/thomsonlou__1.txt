Shoutout to the lovely man who stopped his car to help fill my tyres with air at 6am this morning.

Not all heros wear capes x
@utterclaptrap Nut please do it, we'll all love you for it and if anyone is negative fuck them hahaha x
@el_cartlidge @_JoshFrankland Omg this has made me so happy!!! I'm glad you enjoyed. ü§ó
@_JoshFrankland If you pair have any spare time try city cafe, really good for food and nice little bar!

We have taken down our Christmas decorations today, I am the definition of January blues.
@leeshM_x @markkthomson1
The idea of a large gin and tonic being necked later is helping me get through today.
@korrieriddle Don't pay your rent and see how quickly he gets something sorted.
@DemiAB93 Thank you, same to you dimples! üíñ

@2chiinzzz Have you tried Designated Survivor? It's on Netflix, really good and interesting right from the start!

I think people around me everyday are already sick of my constant Christmas chat. 

BEST. TIME. OF. THE. YEAR.
It feels like everyone is super excited for Christmas already and that makes me very happy.

It's heartbreaking watching someone you love hurting, but there's nothing you can do to fix it for them.
If you expect a man to pay for everything then girls you're half the issue in this world.

The Apprentice is a group of brainless, self obsessed Tories making a fool of themselves and I LOVE IT x
I can't be bothered with those people who always have to be one up. The always done something better types.

JUST LET ME HAVE MY MOMENT.
I can't understand people who can plan outfits a week in advance. What I wear depends on my mood that day???
THERE'S ONLY 8 MORE WEEKS TO CHRISTMAS.

REPEAT, ONLY 8 WEEKS. https://t.co/n8npXHi2Yd
@abbienewtz Omg it's so painful isn't it! Could not believe my luck this morning.
I am LIVING for this ASOS x Hello Kitty collection.

@Debenhams Why are your make up counters always unmanned? I had to rummage the drawers of 4 stands as no one was around to assist. Poor...
Introducing myself to new people: https://t.co/Yme0cXko7b
I want to get to a place in life where I don't need acceptance or validation from anyone. 

Definitely not there yet.
Having wildly inappropriate thoughts then spending five minutes looking around the room to work out if anyone's telepathic and heard you.
Doctors waiting rooms are dangerous. Let's stuff all the ill people in a room together and see what happens.
The autumn fashion is to look like a giant coloured marshmallow in a puffer jacket... and I'm digging it.
I don't get people who go on holiday and wear high heels... Holidays are for relaxing and that includes my feet x
I watched the Van Gogh episode of Doctor Who and now I feel much better.
Urgh @boohoo your clothing range is so good but the app is TERRIBLE. Honestly someone needs to have words with the development team! ‚ùå
It's nearly time to dust off the winter wardrobe. Coats, scarves, hats, gloves, boots and jumpers at the ready.... 

I am SO excited.
I just have to look at a slice of cake and I put on 3lbs.
@505_zo If only we had a money tree...
My favourite hobby is making a list of all the things I need to do rather than actually doing them.
I don't know about anyone else but I'm enjoying the new GBBO. Noel Fielding is what we've been missing all these years. Mel and Who?
Watching docs about Princess Diana's death breaks my heart. The incredible woman was MURDERED. The monarchy's cover up is disgusting.
I'm so excited for new tattoos in the next few months. üíâ
@505_zo I know, it's my turn to be brave and take the leap! Thanks, don't think I could stop even if I wanted to. üôâ
Going through a love/hate relationship with myself. Some days I think everything is okay and others I don't want to even look in the mirror.
On the train and the man in front has the biggest spot on the back of his neck. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad would it be if I popped it?
@meganstamperr Ohhh never heard of it so I'll give it a bash, thanks babe! üíó
When you tell yourself it's going to be a natural make up day then before you know it you've got sparkly eyelids and glowing cheekbones.
@505_zo I'm actually addicted, it's gonna be so pretty. ü§óü§ó
@HairyCaterpilla @KeirGrummitt Thank you my babe, so kind. üò©üíó
@_naebor @KeirGrummitt Thank you papi. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm addicted to Love Island. I know that's bad but I don't care.
@JessicaBeesleyx Ah my god I'm so excited! It's my first time, I feel like I've waited soooo long. Enjoy tomorrow!
I'm seeing Hans Zimmer perform on Sunday and words cannot explain how excited I am. üòç
I enjoy waking up in the middle of the night and realising you still have a few hours to sleep before the alarm clock goes off.
@DemiBauros Thanks. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Being in love is pretty great ain't it?
The internet is a wonderful thing. I have been shopping for the past hour whilst sitting in my pyjamas with a cuppa.
@LordBuckethead Dear sir, were you born into your lordship or did you purchase the title? Asking for a friend.
I'm so proud my favourite hairy babe @KeirGrummitt passing all his uni exams, roll on honours year. 

All my nagging paid off!!! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è
2/2 "Anything to get the tories out." Choosing to vote labour didn't take Tory votes away, it took SNP votes away. Disappointing Scotland.
The Conservatives have won 12 seats in Scotland so far - the party's best performance in Scotland since 1983. 

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!
