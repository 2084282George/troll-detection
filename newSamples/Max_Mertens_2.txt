@maura After seeing your FB post, I'm listening to Swirl 360's Ask Anybody for the first time since high school and it holds up so well.

Didn't realize Mozart's Sister did vocals on this one.
Don't sleep on the new U.S. Girls album that's out today, definitely an early contender for one of my favourite records of the year.
@prodbyharrison Need a whole tape à la Madlib and Freddie Gibbs.
@floorcore They didn't stylize it lIkE tHiS so how do we know they're real fans?

@boarlord_ I am a fan of this cat and also you.
@ffreyhayward Yes.
@cryptochromatic @floorcore This and the whole Top Ranking mixtape were so crucial in my discovery of electronic music.

@aliadarola Heard they recently got a big co-sign from Quincy Jones, excited to see what all the hype's about.
@ariellec Feeling salty about this because Drake has never bought me groceries.
@modernistwitch These tweets are proof this website might not be a complete garbage fire after all.
@jayemkayem Don't forget the DJ set by one of OVO's weed carriers.
Who knew that the key to saving journalism was Quincy Jones interviews?

@therewasnosound "available 4/20"
@dillydill26 I'm seeing the Raptors play the Celtics on Tuesday and it's going to be a barnburner.
The real halftime show was the old-timey piano cover of Kanye's "Runaway" in the Westworld season 2 trailer.
@lydiaohh Happy birthday!
(Real missed opportunity not to have the doctor deliver the baby while on-top of Travis' giant mechanical eagle if you ask me.)
@Nina_Corcoran Seeing the Raptors play the Celtics on Tuesday so enjoy that No. 1 seed while it lasts. :')
Phantom Thread is a movie about brunch culture.
I give it like half a year before Drake or somebody equally big samples a gqom track.
@vine_____comp DJ Lag the hottest ticket in Toronto.
@kaitlynmdavies Would cop.
@danozzi You crazy for this one Dan Ozzi.
@therewasnosound I'm pretty apathetic about the whole thing but I half believe him saying "no Janet appearance" is a fake-out.
@daleweisinger This is good.
@Eytan_Tobin @lag_dj @chippy_nonstop @this_is_walmer @_onthesly I guess I'm camping out early for this :')
@wucandoit @claudiamcneilly We might need a March Madness-style bracket to determine this.
@claudiamcneilly Fair point. Would also throw The Beaconsfield in the running too but it's not really that dingy.
@ezra_marc Circling back into a shallow, empty grave.
@sashakalra Are you rich yet?
