The gym was successful 😃 however, I feel like tomorrow morning could be interesting in terms of moving my arms
80% of the statuses on Facebook either make no sense or make me cringe!
I have loved watching this season of GoT but that horrid scene in episode 9 was not nice viewing..I was thankful for the fast forward button

Imagine this: one day of the year we take a truth pill which makes us say what we really think... that would be a funny/interesting day!
@JW1990 have a good day https://t.co/tRasf3bDmy
In other news, I have set time for 60 hours of catch up tv whilst I'm house bound surrounded by food and wrapped in a duvet. Life.
I think I might be able to set a PB for sleep tonight even after a 3 hour nap at 7..

The doctor next door recommend injections for my back - this could be an interesting night

Making a conscious effort to at least follow the elections this year. It does matter now that I'm a big boy and all...
Conservatives pledging to remove the alcohol ban from football matches. Only snag is, football fans tend not to care about politics unless..
@GregorBanks @JackSwan09 retract that, upgrading to a lunch 😏
@JackSwan09  @GregorBanks IKEA Banksy ;)  #improvise

Question - does a foot war at work fall under any work place acts?
@fin1991Official you might implode with all that ego
@fin1991Official nope, scrap that. On the ball. This was an old tweet. Yep, I can still confirm just as much of a tool. Just not as much..
I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope. http://t.co/KMS6R5jcVJ
Eating noisey food in a quiet room is uncomfortable for all involved
Promised a KFC, expect that promise to be fulfilled!
Give the "does god exist?" debate a listen to on youtube! William Lane Craig vs. Christopher Hitchens - great way to pass time on a journey!
