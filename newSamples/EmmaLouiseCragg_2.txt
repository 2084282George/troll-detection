Hey @virginmedia, why are we being charged for 2 of your reps giving out false information, and being harrassed by email, text and post?
And if you don't see this happening, you're the problem üëçüèª #dangerousdriving https://t.co/IAeMpXNOwh
It appears that no Chinese takeaways in Dunfermline are capable of delivering even within an hour of when they say they will üò°
@TheForthBridges What's causing the miles of queues N/B right now? Can't see why we've been stationary for serveral minutes miles from QC
To the Range Rover who has just shunted us off the road into the back of another car before driving off, I hope you're REALLY proud. Prick.
4 miles of queues northbound to cross @TheForthBridges
@emma_oneill @TheForthBridges I hope it clears a bit for you!

@TheForthBridges Its a bit more than that, we've been stuck in the northbound traffic for 53 minutes and still can't see the bridges
By far the worst this traffic has ever been. What a great day to open a new bridge.
Had it been publicised the anoraks who want to cross for fun could have done it already and commuters wouldn't be h‚Ä¶ https://t.co/HSgqj0bNld
Traffic is bumper to bumper from the Queensferry Crossing to past Dunfermline....
@colinmochrie Are you doing any meet &amp; greets after the Whose Line shows? üòä
Just banged my head on a jar of chocolate spread. Why do the things I love hurt me?
Love it when the police attend a noise complaint, the reported people see them coming and turn the music down so I look stupid -.-
Ignoring computer updates for 3 weeks results in a bad time when it updates without your permission. Lesson learned.
Dundee we're coming for you! 

This  hilarious jukebox musical is coming to the Whitehall get your tickets now! https://t.co/qpDb8fdXpB
WATCH:  A chronological history of UK and Irish boybands from 1984 to present day by The Sons of Pitches. https://t.co/nKCg6gW4Ui
Can we just address how genuinely beautiful @sutanamrull is, both physically and as a person? That will be all.
Loving @pewdiepie's playthrough of the Outlast 2 demo. New horror games that are actually scary are thin on the ground right now...
@saracaves You just blew up my phone with twitter notifications...
I'm never more impatient than when I'm waiting for onion rings to cook.

@EmmaLouiseCragg @Jack_Septic_Eye On the plus side, hearing his voice in my head has taught me a perfect Irish accent.
Christmas dinner is my favourite time of year.
On an unrelated note, the worst part of being an adult is forgetting to buy milk, then having to tackle the day without breakfast üòû
I am sorry to all the Puerto Ricans I may have offended with my accent work today.

I always feel such contentment the night after submitting a really difficult essay. Doesn't last long, but it's nice for those few seconds.
Politics essay is due on Friday and I've only just decided on the question I'm going to answer. Still, an improvement on the last one...

I wish I was @manilaluzon's friend...
A preordered copy of @tyleroakley's book makes me a very happy bunny.
@MathleteBSquare @EilidhTee @kirstytlr Christ on a bike! Haha. I was kind of hoping this would never resurface üòÇ
Happy bees and pestilence day, folks! Spread the love.
I'm sorry, but why did nobody inform me that there was a second Spongebob movie coming out? This is the sort of thing I need to know!
When I'm sad, I look up the Welsh translations for things, and then I'm not sad any more.
...Unless I'm well-rested and ready to deal with the inevitable shit storm.
@markiplier I just watched your 'Draw My Life' video (late to the party, my bad), and now I can't stop crying. I hope things are better now
(I should probably have explained that I'm watching Disney's Hercules...)
Just because you are offended, that doesn't mean that you are right.
Someone has spilled liquid soap on our bathroom floor. I stepped in it with socks on, and now hate everything. And I thought water was bad!
Listening to a chipmunk having a sneezing fit is highly amusing, however much you feel sorry for them.
@EllieJane1975 I love you a bit you know :P x
@EllieJane1975 But where's Christopher Robin?? D: x
@EllieJane1975 I've got two weeks off then, so that would be perfect :D x
@EllieJane1975 Fancy a wee shopping trip to Glasgow in a few weeks? I'm bored of Perth :) x
Fancying a spontaneous weekend in London but I'm feeling far too lazy at the moment.
I'm an apathetic sociopath; I'd kill you if I cared.
After falling asleep watching @pewdiepie's videos for the last 3 weeks, my subconscious has started to speak in his voice. He's in my brain!
Peter Capaldi is already my favourite Doctor.
General Lamarque is dead!
But, of course, you'd know that if you'd got your ticket for Les Miserables this weekend.

Never get Manchester wet and never feed it after midnight, otherwise it turns into Liverpool.
@ejafit Are you one of the lucky ones who has been able to see it live? Or are you just going to watch it on Sunday?
This coach is filled with the overwhelming scent of oranges... Still got another 11 hours to go and it's already giving me a headache :(
I had a dream in which @gblagden was singing 'I only want to say', and woke up crying.
I just googled 'animals in hats' because reasons, and now I feel my life is complete.
Who do I have to sell my soul to in order to have @reevecarney sing to me just once? Just once? Because I'll do it.
We're only an hour behind schedule, no big deal.
Watched and transcribed 23 episodes of CBeebies bedtime stories for use in our preschoolers class... Now I'm thinking like a toddler.
If you're aged 19 or under and live in the Perth area, come and take part in our summer project! It will be great fun http://t.co/QYND7MtYun
@BenWillingdorf @onlyrasberry I saw this and thought of you guys... It's a tiny turtle wearing a raspberry :D http://t.co/VIExuOIGVO

@PooleyDude That I am :)
"If music be the food of love..."
I'd rather have pizza, to be honest.
You want to go and watch @JamesChatsTV on YouNow don't you? You do. Don't lie. I can see right through you. http://t.co/eLt4Gr5iVl
@MathleteBSquare Know how that feels babe! -21C up a Kenyan mountain; brrrrr! x

@danisnotonfire Are you in Glasgow Saturday or Sunday?
@TashaOrm @ejafit And thanks for watching, saved me sitting there looking like an idiot for an hour XD
@TashaOrm About to go live, would be great if you could come check it out for a minute so I'm not talking to myself! Haha
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 Good!
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 Haha, yeah. Wait, is this on tinychat or Google?
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 I think the link was http://t.co/S86NWkByC1 wasn't it? I've signed out now, I can't remember.
@EllieJane1996 To be fair, I think everyone was on his side :P
@oliverlupton1 @thurs_jay Is that easy to use? I'll have to make an account.
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 Whoo!
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 It says I'm friends with both of you now, but I don't know if it's actually worked
@oliverlupton1 @thurs_jay I can't find it either...
@BenWillingdorf What I mean is the accent you have is different to mine, but I think I've accidentally adopted yours now! Haha :D
More people should go follow @onlyrasberry. He's such a nice guy, and you should check out his YouTube too. I'd appreciate it folks xx
Don't knock the Yorkshire accent, @oliverlupton1!
@aidanmcconachie Oh! Makes sense I guess :) It looked kind of toxic
