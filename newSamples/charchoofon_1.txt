I'm trying to share with you the blueberry cake me and @hasmataz made earlier, however Twitter doesn't seem to want you to see it :(
@Helen_Musi it's pronounced char like shoe, actually.
Oh Konnie, what were you thinking? Cringe Factor 10..
We're 21. Our night has consisted of painting pictures of each other, baking a blueberry cake and discussing how to use twitter.. Feel OLD.
I'm on a mission to beat my housemates on twitter.. How do I get people to follow me?
Mmmm Blueberry cake!! Yummm.
I want to be back in bed! Bacteria are the bain of my life.
@hasmataz heyyy!! what the freak do we do on twitter???
Follow my friend's #LifeStew for the bast tips on what's hot! He needs as many followers as possible to get his dream job!!
I got a papercut from the lab health and safety forms..ironic. Bloody hurts.
