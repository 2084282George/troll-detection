This really made me miss the community in SF. Great read @pizzalane! https://t.co/Ku67Ehba57

I never do these, but RIP Chuck Barris. This manâ€™s work changed the course of modern American pop culture forever. Sad to see him go.
@Ember_ebooks Whoever made this ad is a viral marketing genius. I predict that Grizzly Long Cut will be the techno dipper's choice in 2017.
@Ember_ebooks Hard to hate, especially when the sun is showing its face. You know?
@lufthansa Cool thanks.

@timelessmixes Don't get your hopes up!
Excited to have worked on this with the guys at @BASSSIANI. It sounds like they really have something special in Tbâ€¦ https://t.co/9rfcjxnIgC
@ShawnReynaldo @RBMA Sounds like a Vice headline.
@brisaelizabeth Can you even read this tweet?
@mhgbrown @brandonhaslegs noooooo
@brandonhaslegs Is this set in stone or what?

The sound installation at @analogbkny is absolutely unreal. Smell of talcum and warmly familiar disco melodies still drift through the mind

@ShawnReynaldo How long will you be in New York? I'm headed there on Thursday. If you're around maybe we can meet up?
@djdials Do you have a live recording?

@timelessmixes What radio show are you speaking of?
Shuggie Otis - "Sweet Thang" (https://t.co/2Lu9Tphgho)
I'm now convinced that there's a conspiracy at work killing all the cool pop stars.
Berlin ain't LA, but I'll still listen to this on any sunny day. DÃ¢m-Funk - "A Beautiful Day" https://t.co/7DV6FbGf9f
@basmooy Maybe it was just my state of mind last time ;) I did enjoy it! Just what I needed on a Sunday morning.
Berghain on Sunday morning with Bas Mooy and UVB was pretty underpopulated. Music was way less aggressive than the last Mord party.
@c__mm No, but had a good time with you guys though!
Weird night at Panorama Bar yesterday. Crowd was off. Track selection was disjointed. I guess that's what I get for going on a Friday...
Geoffrey Oryema - "Kel Kweyo (Joe Claussell Remix)" https://t.co/c1hsMxoL7P
@willfewell At least they're having some dialog about it...
Now listening to "Don't You Know" by Jan Hammer Group via @Radiooooo_com https://t.co/EX1z9YQ1Oq
@ShawnReynaldo It's never too late, Shawn. Follow your dreams.

Nowadays people complain about techies in SF. Back in the '70s, it was a different story...CBS 5 has the scoop: https://t.co/NjAFwZFutr

@timelessmixes When I was doing rips I had a Rega RP1 turntable with a Denon DL-110 attached.
@timelessmixes You'd probably want to go full-on audiophile, honestly. I don't think Ortofon is good enough.
If only all electronic music sounded like this: https://t.co/Q2liKKtmTt
@timelessmixes Different style than Carter or Tenaglia though. Iâ€™m surprised youâ€™ve not gotten off on his sets, heâ€™s a diggerâ€™s DJ.
Didn't listen to techno for a month. Back in Berlin and @eric_cloutier's RA mix has me wondering what I was thinking https://t.co/skzg6IWiP8
Itâ€™s a political campaign worthy of a Dr. Bronnerâ€™s bottle.
@GreatDismal I like to think we live somewhere between a post-core and pre-post-post world.
@mhgbrown Moldova is going to be so gentrified in a few years
@timelessmixes I will defer to your opinion on this one.
@timelessmixes Hopefully it's 320?
@timelessmixes Where did you grab the recording? It sounds like Terje or a heavily Terje indebted kind of thing.
"My favorite movie is me and orange sunshine glass and we be cruzin' and peace and we got 2 minutes left and t..." https://t.co/6vr1uS8fdd
Just "Santa Cruzin"
@timelessmixes I'd say that's more of a fact than an opinion.
@brandonhaslegs It's apparently recognizing secret UFO moonbases everywhere. http://t.co/m3YmsTwFPN
@ShawnReynaldo That's pretty damn impressive considering how uncomfortably packed it was up in there.
@ShawnReynaldo You back in town? If so...See ya there for at least 7 of those 24 hours.
@timelessmixes  I'm sure it sounds good, but nobody's going to be doing anything fun with an isolator with only +8dB boost.
Still feeling some major residual SF nostalgia following @HNYSNDSYSTM's incredible 6hr set at Panorama Bar. https://t.co/OgehwlCJ40
We think your readers would enjoy the album for these reasons: "It's the first rap album to tackle world history in a comprehensive way"

@brandonhaslegs She actually killed someone, those are hacked up body parts, she's going to drop em and let em dissolve in the Landwerkanal.
I'm kind of confused that it took this long to hear someone play Dead or Alive's "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" in Panorama Bar.
...Or, I should say, Sugarcubes to a super sleaze cover of Bacioti's Black Jack. Also, Ann Joy's edit on there is a real mind fuck.
@FACTmag "popular"
Friday's @DystopianMusic party was so next level that they even had a line of geriatric Germans outside waiting to judge you as you left.
As if Harvey's Boiler Room last night wasn't enough, Slow to Speak just dropped this ridiculously dope June BBQ mix: https://t.co/QKmyU7dOTP
