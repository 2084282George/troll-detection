@David_Rudnick ...and Melenchon may be cooperating w/ Hamon in the end. A stronger left with real social/progressist ideas.
@David_Rudnick indeed ! Melenchon/Hamon are reaching for a 6th "republic" and beyond the polls, fair ideas are spreading among younger gens
@David_Rudnick FR press takes Hamon quite seriously now that he's won the PS' primaries - he's quite the surprise
@David_Rudnick a Macron/Le Pen draw is shaping up but there's a bit of hope with Hamon.
