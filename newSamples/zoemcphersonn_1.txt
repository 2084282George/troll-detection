@Rroxymore it actually reminds me of clubs/bars looking for ONLY vinyl &amp; female DJs. ugh honestly? will that make your bar cool mate?
@Rroxymore This is such a f""" trendy thing to say.. ffs. You can make great stuff with just a tape player and a hammer
@Rroxymore Who cares actually right - being open in general is what I'd vote for.
