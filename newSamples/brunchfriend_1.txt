Phantom Thread is about the horror of watching the one you love cook and eat in a manner that disturbs you greatly

Asking the BIG Qs on the #LFF red carpet for @ASacredDeer. https://t.co/ZhzfNWsXe4
@MissCorinneOh This is super cool Corinne!
First experience of a Film4 #LFF red carpet for #SacredDeer. @BarryKeoghan showed us his Dior boots. SEE THE MOVIE, it's unbelievable.
Angels Wear White has such quiet rage. Systemic abuse enabled by men looking the other way for their own gain. A vital, devastating film.
A visual representation of how watching this film makes you feel. Takes the skin clean off. https://t.co/ZJPTRZl4gg
Erin Markey's Boner Killer at @YardTheatre is very funny and strange, like the darkest recesses of your mind performed as a musical. Go see!
ALSO appetites; greed, thirst, sex mess, reading, the correct way to eat a soft boiled egg, the thrill of a covert cigarette on holiday.
Essential world-class documentary. Watch for free on the telly! https://t.co/Qk9P7edeg7
Ok fine https://t.co/uMLFwyZe4C
I Am Not a Witch is unbelievable. A fable of superstition, tradition, misogyny and modernity. Theatrical in its design and tragicomedy. #LFF
@dirtisox god this is adorbs

Damn it looks good. That comic timing always gets me. https://t.co/o41c19id4X
Ben Rivers' Urth is SO beautiful. Notes from a lonely biosphere w/hints of Kubrick, Silent Running, Paradise Lost.… https://t.co/cOzemKAhvT
I liked it a lot. Surprisingly gripping and moving. Vast and sprawling in scope but deeply personal. Perfectly edited.
@handronicus what's an aha? my skin is dreadful
@redfacts @Film4 It's an excellent idea. Will pass it on. #AutumnalOscar

Disorientating, curiously moving, very beautiful eastern/western. See it! https://t.co/s6KkMs8wgw
@Film4 Lost in Translation. Royal Tenenbaums. Eden! https://t.co/7QNlSSUlZd
Lanthimos' worlds are emotional vacuums with their own plausible logics. Farrell is so amazingly flat and funny. Yorgos got me messed UP.
Waiting for curtain up at the @BFI #LFF programme launch 🎞 https://t.co/V2160dMxYB
Over the moon to be part of the @Film4 fam as of last week. Goodbye to the wonderful @ICALondon https://t.co/M30KXaaA6R
