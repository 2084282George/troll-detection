@fellaby Have you heard of House of Erotique? I feel they are right up your street.
Instagram being vain is lost on me... I love seeing people express themselves. Being creative with clothes, makeup‚Ä¶ https://t.co/52f3fEpO3E
Personally I think people should take it as a compliment if someone wants to take inspiration from your style. They're not "copying".
It's so annoying when people post an outfit photo on Instagram but don't tag where the pieces are from. Sharing is caring???
@_JoshFrankland To add to that Boozy Cow... burgers and cocktails in a can, you can't go wrong. üòéüòÇ
New season of @CatfishMTV starts tonight. https://t.co/MkZ8lN6YQb
@samanthalalaa I'm howling. üòÇ
Every Saturday morning we lie in bed both trying to defend why the other person should make tea and breakfast.

When multiple delivers arrive on the same day, the clothes look exactly like the photos AND everything fits. https://t.co/c4V30AgR8i
Don't wear any velvet around me because I will try to stroke you.
I'm back to work today and drowning in sadness, how can the festivities be over already?
My 2018 is going to consist of taking more photos, drinking more cocktails, planning more holidays and adding a gif‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QPom5FTOHv

"Don't rush, I'm wrapping presents" is like a festive sext.
@1littleroo ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I've got a bad case of 'don't want to move from my bed' this morning.
I can't get off Instagram because I'm obsessed with all the festive pictures.

Incredible doc, recommend getting on catch up if you can. 97,000 rapes happen per year, 3% are convicted.

Every time I stare at my boyfriend he asks "what is it"

CAN I NOT JUST STARE AT THE LOVE OF MY LIFE LIKE A CREEP IN PEACE PLS???
@hayleyburt0n Yes! He ripped it to shreds, and quite right as it's a total rip off. üòÇ
I promised Keir full decision making on what Christmas decorations we buy and I am VERY nervous about the outcome of my irrational kindness.
@JudyMurray Give us a wave Judy, looking great in the orange top tonight x #AndyMurrayLive
@ASOS_HeretoHelp I need to discuss a refund, is there a phone number to speak to someone please?
Excitement level 100. https://t.co/e2QfeDvjdg
First Christmas living with Keir, he doesn't know it yet but he will be living in a winter wonderland through the month of December x
Ordered ¬£200 worth of clothes from ASOS last night and today they have 20% off. 

WHAT HAVE I DONE TO DESERVE THIS? https://t.co/W94hJtoqaL
I wake up in the night thinking I'm on fire and realise it's just Keir, wrapping his entire 6'3" body around me for a cuddle.
If you don't fangirl over your own boyfriend, what are you doing?
When you fall in love with a piece of clothing, patiently keep it in your saved basket, payday arrives and it goes‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mWGT58fuia
It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon and I'm still in my pjs. 

I LUV HOLIDAYS.
I have already bought Christmas presents. I'M SUCH A MIDDLE AGED MUM.
55 items in my saved basket on ASOS. Payday on Friday. Highly likely I'm going to sin before the week is over.
Proud to be growing up in a generation of women who are fighting to be fearless, outspoken and self loving. https://t.co/KRWO812IFC
If you are already excited about Christmas then you're my kind of person.
@TheGingerGeek06 Me too! Such a beautiful episode.

Thank you to the French for the masterpiece, the pain au chocolat.
Nothing worse than getting to the platform just as your train pulls away.
Does anyone else look forward to Noel Fielding's weekly outfit on GBBO?
There is only 105 days to Christmas. I can almost taste the turkey sandwiches and Terry's chocolate orange.
Ever feel like you've lost your way and you don't even know where to start to get back on track? Yuck.
I know being independent and strong is important, but sometimes it's just nice to know you have someone by your side any time you need them.
My little brother's in Ibiza and I'm a nervous wreck. Reasonable considering his pals and him caused the summer of 15' Magaluf fire.
@505_zo Oh definitely! August is super busy but start of September before you're at uni we could do another brunch? ü§ó

Tickets booked for @edfringe! Buzzzzzing.
@aliii_lou Never looked on there, will give it a go! Thank you hun. üíñ
@el_cartlidge I've been on Etsy but there's too much choice (which I know sounds crazy). I'll give King &amp; McGaw a try, thank you! üíì
Do you ever look at someone you used to fancy and thank the lord it didn't work out x
Started shopping for the new home... I want EVERYTHING copper.
@505_zo @KeirGrummitt Thank you babe!! Once we're settled in you and Liam will need to come through for a visit. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï
Super excited to share that me and @KeirGrummitt signed the papers for our first place today. We're officially moving in together!!! üë´üè°
I'm not feeling the new twitter layout. The old saying "if it's not broken, don't try to fix it" comes to mind.
@laurenwills21 Omg me too, it's such a beauty. I don't think it matters what he plays I'll be an emosh mess!
My first email this morning was to my manager asking for a half day. That's what you call doing Friday right.
I'm so broody. I just love babies and their cute little chubby cheeks and toes. I want them ALL.
@Nettofabulous I will agree with you on that.
One of those days where you wake and immediately start counting down the hours until back in bed.
@utterclaptrap Omg I love you x
*help pls*

I want to start a blog to get more creative, would anyone read about food/cool eating places?
@CampbellxEmma There's a big increase on Labour votes, that were previously SNP. If they had remained voting SNP it‚Ä¶ https://t.co/wIRcCgVqEn
1/2 Let's be clear, SNP did not lose votes to the Tories. We lost seats because people jumped ship to vote Labour to support Corbyn.
Genuinely concerned for tomorrow's outcome. I will be one sad human if I wake up to another Tory government. #GE17
