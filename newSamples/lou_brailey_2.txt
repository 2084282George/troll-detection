My gf here, with the most awkward ‚Äòhaha‚Äô ever committed to text: https://t.co/PQinyuemKT
what are Red Vines?
@sophwilkinson It all sounds so familiar. 

It was a fucking rad time ‚Äì poppers all down my baggy jeans. A vibe.
I love the cold weather. I get to make endless references to Carol/losing gloves ‚Äì a foolproof way to ID any les in the room!
Just so you know, when I get married I‚Äôm not having speeches but a series of panels about me and my gf
Yes, we need to address the underlying reasons that there‚Äôs a pressure on masc lesbians to ‚Äògo all the way‚Äô ‚Äì I‚Äôve had the talk a bunch BUT
Sometimes I bore myself with the nonsense I chat. Today I was sure ‚Äúeasy-peeler‚Äù was supermarket-speak for non-legit citrus fruit.
@davyreed Pastiche pizza :(
The Kedr Livanskiy album is slowly becoming one of my favourites of 2017.
Massively into being a part of this.‚ù£Ô∏è https://t.co/5wC6iov3hV
@JCalvert_music hahaha‚Ä¶ yeah, when I do write I remember I don‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm being needlessly contrary.
So many great anthology series but I‚Äôm out here waiting on a Tales of the Unexpected renaissance.
No sadness on earth like the sadness felt when you don‚Äôt get tickets to the Silence of the Lambs Jodie Foster Q&amp;A at the @BFI.
@EmilyRoseMackay tell me about it
@gwyntdc @JoshWinning Yoga it is. I‚Äôve never had a work posture assessor in any job ever. Envious of those who do.
The man interviewing me asked because, ‚Äòhe wouldn‚Äôt want anyone going to HR‚Äô. This was in 2008 btw
I bet St Vincent could write a hell of a contemporary Broadway musical a la Jeanine Tesori. I can think of no higher praise.
Throwing sins down the river but instead of bread I guess some people use nos canisters? #RoshHashana
No art has moved me like Angels in America and I saw Boston Marriage with Anna Chancellor and Zo√´ Wanamaker
Wanna make yourself feel old? Stand by yourself at a Lana Del Rey gig in Cos trousers üòé
Quite fancy a trip to Berlin. What's happening in the coming weeks, Berliner mates? Also, lakes.
... but I can't help feeling low 'cos it gives more credence to that horrible, horrible argument that 'closet cases' are the most homophobic
Wow, not used to straight people giving this much of a shit about celebs coming out... y'all got a crush on Tyler or?
Girlfriend leans in, lowers voice: "you need botox," she says.
Creature Comfort is fake-profound in the same way Virtual Insanity was fake-profound but that was 20 years ago. Stop it.
@TomRisteSmith ‚Äì apologies for being so slow ‚Äì I've just seen your email (and replied)
@blackmadonnachi @virginmedia LOL!
@laurasnapes Yes, precisely! HIYA!
When I heard Jonathan Demme died yesterday, I couldn‚Äôt leave the house. Some lesbian visibility day!
Oh wow, Kablam used a track from a Peter Greenaway film in her RA mix. Universe, you're very indulgent to my quite specific tastes rn
My tooth is hanging out and not a single dentist in Bristol will see me, including the ones given by the NHS helpline
Every day is #iwd2017 round mine by which I mean every day I bookmark long-reads about Phyllis Diller's gag archive
Dear Mariella, I'm heading to my niece's bday meal but I didn't know I'd be going and I look kinda off for Bill's T‚Ä¶ https://t.co/8S7cJduReN
@JoshWinning Your Sundance tweets are making me jealous. Did you catch Kuso at all?
Spending Saturday night reading case studies on the BBFC website for fun. You?
Last few days of LDN. Then, somehow, we're moving to Bristol. I'm so stressed I anxiety-unwrapped all my presents &amp; wrapped them again‚Äîworse
@anomiseditrix Good to hear. Hugs to you...
Wow, what a cover. Iconic, that. https://t.co/jQ3JtqT6UP
Sometimes just *existing* in majority male/straight spaces is exhausting. Just a quick üëè üëè  to all my women dealing with this shit.
Um, @businessinsider offering tips for flying, including wearing loose clothing. Great, but for this lil morsel, which made me LOL:
Listening to the @wittertainment podcast, am I right to assume the correspondent deriding Nocturnal Animals is none other than @laurasnapes?
Ah, the new Night Czar is our scene mom. I'm so fucking happy right now.
@DiagonalRecords That would be so rad, gutted I missed out.
I can't decide if the reason I'm happy is a) the next artist I'm interviewing is so rad or b) the new supermoon or c) oh it's passed
Pro tip life hack: there's loads of unclaimed conkers in Shoreditch Park. You're welcome.
Remember when Trevor and Simon performed with the Pet Shop Boys?
Hyped about being on a panel with @RalphusMoorus &amp; @Eamonn_Forde at #PEW2016. TL;DR: If you're making exciting music, I wanna hear.
I'm not the only one. So thank you @fabriclondon. No other club, not even Berghain, would come as close to blowing my mind clean open.
Dead proud of this one! https://t.co/T0HmDWF4q5
Coming soon on Diagonal https://t.co/FachJQYede
My 30s is one run-on memory of navigating a staircase in a club while Sex Dwarf plays from different rooms at various points in the night
@anomiseditrix @mslauralipstick I am contorted with jealousy right now!

Berlin, I can't wait to throw my little islander arms around you and spend my devalued pounds on your now-not-quite-so-cheap beer ‚ù§Ô∏è
Back in Berlin 8th ‚Äì 11th July. Hold onto yer hatssssss weirdo crew @lisablanning @guccigoth
Yung Lean on Eurovision VT, because it's 2016 guys. We took all our idols and smashed them.
At the House of Commons for a charity Carl Cox set. Whole new genres of sunglasses being discovered, right here, in the corridors of power
Just lost my kitsch as hell Jubilee Oyster card on the overground to Crystal Palace. Anyone see it, I really miss it :-(
@aimeecliff FFS
Pls no
Kids on Uni Challenge only know Fiona Shaw from Harry Potter. Philistines! It's Three Men and a Little Lady surely?!
@Lord_Wozza @functionfixers @TheLondonEye nah
@JoshWinning soooo excitedddddd
Then again, SEO and all that, it's a different age.
@joeryrie Amazing doc. Makes me miss my daily beigel during the heady Profile days.
Apart from that, the exhibition's really rad.
I changed my hairstyle for the first time in 5 years this weekend, happy Valentine's to meeeeee
The cinema I'm in is in fits. This is surreal. #YeezySeason3
There's a bit of my life that's hazy. Like Bowie, but instead of creating Station to Station, I made lots of posts about 2nd tier German DJs
Still adjusting to London clubbing tbh but I did actually dance to @nidiaminaj's set last night, so it's all good. Nice vibe, too.
My heart hurts.
Anyone else headed to C2C (the festival in Turin, not the Southend train operator) this weekend?
Dude who drives around Kensington in a gold Bentley is, surprisingly, a prat with low self-esteem. Swore at me for laughing at his car. Bye.
This is very cool https://t.co/3onLvhJrBI
Black TNs are the official footwear of Lewisham, it seems. Good therapy for me, in a way.
The neighbours, two middle aged men, are having a BBQ in the cold. Mood: joyless. Is this a cry for help?
Notting Hill is full of skinny white women screaming at cars and tugging at their hair. Are they ok? Do they need help? Why don't I care?
In Paris this weekend. What are the cool parties I should check? I have a blind spot when it comes to this city.
