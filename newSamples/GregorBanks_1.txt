@JamesClarkson96 It happens when you least expect it!
@nommmmmi Doh! Have they rectified the issue?
@WilliamHill #YourOdds over 3 goals, over 2 cards, over 10 corners Man Utd vs Yeovil
@bequietamy I heard the heating wasn’t even broken :/
@jimseven No mention of biodegradable cups??
@nommmmmi @bequietamy I thought it was just wax on the outside!

@jamsey2004 @ConorDow @PYFSaltires @sfl_superleague @sfl_perth @TheFutsalShop @PKFairtrade @The_PA @PerthandKinross… https://t.co/tLRbdJw3Us
@jonforeman How about we talk about it over a coffee?
@jamsey2004 Hahahaha would have made a big difference. How did you get on?
@ManUtd @BlindDaley @adidasfootball @jamsey2004 see these?
@atarrant81 Couldn't have predicted the goal scorers too?
@laurenafterall Always.
@BrianRobertson8 @mick_k86 @switchfoot I booked tickets for London and then they got announced for Glasgow 😂
@ConorDow @jamsey2004 24. James loved it too
@kiwipendleton Yes. I'm off until 29th.
@JamesClarkson96 Join in
@kiwipendleton @nommmmmi You'd need to refresh my memory
@nommmmmi I like the speech by Samuel L Jackson in Coach Carter about it.
@nommmmmi Can it be used by anybody?
@JustinWelby @JamesClarkson96 @matt_redman @yoonjames
@BrianRobertson8 @AmeliaSofia 😂
@WilliamHill That's not the bet I'm asking for. I don't believe both teams will score. Celtic to win both halves, and Griffiths to score.
@WilliamHill Celtic to win both halves, Griffiths to score. #YourOdds
@hasbean Hi, I'm looking to get some info on wholesale decaf options?
@WilliamHill Man Utd to win both halves, btts, Rashford to score #YourOdds
This is the best @ManUtd team I've seen all season
@jamsey2004 I'll buy a tub of paint and do our boots
@ManUtd @jamsey2004 I've seen a goal like this recently
@nommmmmi what are good alternatives?
@hayleyrclark £150. Had £10 on.
@jamsey2004 three games in a week too much for you??
Sanchez on the bench and Ozil not even in the squad...
Can't wait for my alarm to go off at 4:40am.
@mick_k86 absolute shambles of a club these days
@laurenafterall must know what you're like!
@laurenafterall three has already aired too 🙄
@laurenafterall from misery to happiness today?
@EdinburghRugby is the car park open today? How much is it?
@JamesClarkson96 @sammy_robinson1 sick invite bro
@laurenafterall :/
@neevcochrane @laurenafterall ehm, I'll sit the row in front? :)
@bequietamy still rich! :)
@laurenafterall fatherson are playing the street party so you're good with the standard ticket 👌
@laurenafterall separate if they're playing the gardens
Level of candidates left in The Apprentice is shocking.
@laurenafterall take me 🙋🏻‍♂️
@HR_Clark Kraków?
@laurenafterall ayeeeee
@sammy_robinson1 or Americans are just clueless
@bequietamy @nommmmmi me too
@nommmmmi 😂😂
Anyone for Jack Reacher late tomorrow night?
@islafraser7 gotta get doing some more covers first...
@nommmmmi you'll need to teach me! :)
Guy online trying to get me to quit by scoring continuous own goals and pausing the game 😴😴
@neevcochrane yeah, they're far too much drama 💁
@HR_Clark I'd be more surprised if the opposite happened
Which game should I be watching? #UCL @son_of_a_gunn @BrianRobertson8 @mick_k86 @JamesClarkson96
@nommmmmi standard 😂
@islafraser7 Soz... They're touring in November! You should go see them :)
@islafraser7 😂😂😂 they were sooooooo good at Bellahouston last night :)
@islafraser7 did you see they covered Matt Cardle tonight!?
@sammy_robinson1 😂😂
@HR_Clark sounds like a weird date to me! 😂
@sammy_robinson1 you're the only reason I need
@BrianRobertson8 @JamesClarkson96 @son_of_a_gunn it's a secret. 6-4-0
@neevcochrane hahaha what!? I'm confused reading this
@son_of_a_gunn really surprised! I'm usually a huge fan of BA. It's KLM I always have a bad experience with.
@laurenafterall yes, I most certainly do! :) praying for your guys time over there
@neevcochrane @laurenafterall what's going on whilst you guys are there? :)
@sammy_robinson1 it's a grower :)
@sammy_robinson1 not sure if I dig it yet
Marcus Rashford, the youngest player in the squad, was the only player that had anything about him, and he got 5 minutes 👌
Wandering around the Tate Modern and not really sure what I'm supposed to think. What is considered art these days?
@British_Airways come on! Flight delayed to London City from Edinburgh because of technology issues!?
Not a fan of Nicola or the SNP but give this a read.  https://t.co/QpHJuVF7VW
@BeckyRitchiee what did go wrong?
@LauraCoops19 just wait until you get there before you make that comment. Arizona heat is too much
Think I'm finally realising that people don't actually care.
It's too hot to even sleep
@sammy_robinson1 oh my goodness samwell
How we are feeling after a cancelled flight and a 12 hour wait  https://t.co/nC63GpKN9V
@mick_k86 Lorenzo Amoruso?
@Quinny_280 painted a really good wall in art class one time.
@nommmmmi new season any good?
What just happened to @ManUtd!?
@HR_Clark definition of absolutely wild...? 😂
@LauraCoops19 maybe she meant somewhere for dinner 😂
@islafraser7 phew! Thanks pal. Too kind.
@islafraser7 I'll accept a biffy cover in the meantime then 💁
@melanieward19 you're awesome! :)
