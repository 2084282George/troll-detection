May as well be known as Daniel MacDonald as if it's not my first name it's my second 🙄😂
@nommmmmi You look amazing!!❤️
Pay day tomorrow and Black Friday sales, this could be dangerous😶
@yellalongbottom Did you spell it Daniel people tend to do so 😂
So we can unlock phones with faces but can't edit a tweet 🤔
@x_itsashleigh_x Not even funny I hate them 😭😭❤️😭
@x_itsashleigh_x Sounds a bit like me 😂😂
Christmas songs have started! I'm not sorry!😊🎄❄️⛄️🎅🏻🤶🏻
@x_itsashleigh_x @amyswan998 Don't worry I'll get it covered 😂😂
@Unco0rdinated Exactly but people still can't see it !!

@MayaLittle20x @mia_fauldsx  😂
@Bethmackinnon7 I've not seen you in ages
@kylefummey They keep phoning me 😂😂
@Unco0rdinated Well I don't understand rugby @JackLeathem01
@kylefummey You're so good you should be in a band!
"All the cat does is sleep and eats all day and she's a bit stupid... Reminds me of you" Thanks Ally🙃👍🏻
@Bethmackinnon7 When can I move in ??
@amyswan998 Best thing in the world 🙃🙃
Mum still goes in a mood with me if I wear green and refuses to be beside me, rangers fan right there 😂
@euanmclell_ Well you have Birthdays to come that's us set for a good 4 years 👍🏻😂
I probably laughed more seeing IT than jumped tbh🤡😂
Missing someone and knowing you can't do anything about it is the worst💔
I'd pay someone if they sat and played with my hair 💆🏻
@Unco0rdinated Yeah I'll admit it's not screaming pain more like a cat scratching you none stop for however long it takes 😂
@beth_anna123 Always love a message from you Beth❤️
@x_itsash_x 😔 defos getting extra cuddles on Wednesday❤️❤️
@bequietamy @x_itsash_x Look at Ashleigh's Facebook page ❤️
@beth_anna123 Obviously
@beth_anna123 I've just put a pun on my story so don't worry you're not as bad as me 🙃😂😂😂😂
Wanting to say something to someone but not wanting to ruin your friendship🤷🏻‍♀️😶
@x_itsash_x @zoee_hunter @clairedickson_ @bethanysworld_ @_naomimcgrath @lifeoflorri @CHLOECCARROLL Hope we get a snap or text 😂
@x_itsash_x That me being replaced ?? 😂❤️
@x_itsash_x 😂😂
@x_itsash_x Aww yeah! And I mean you're practically family anyways 😂
@x_itsash_x It's someone in my dad's work that's why he can talk to them when he's in 😂
@x_itsash_x My provisional took ages so I need to start lessons asap!😂😂
@x_itsash_x ❤️❤️❤️❤️
If I got a £1 everytime a customer replied "I'm sweet enough" when I ask if they want sugar I wouldn't need to work anymore😂
2/3weeks until I become Auntie Dan again🎉🎀❤️ @x_itsash_x
@x_itsash_x Agreed I'd never switch it on tbh!
@kathryntatlowx Idk why but I found this hilarious 😂😂
@jacko200118 I now don't feel so bad when I mix you two up 😂
When people start asking me why I'm at a certain location on Snapchat thats when ghost mode goes on🙃😂
Honestly better if someone just sends "hi" rather than sending "snap me" multiple times a day🙂
@laurenafterall I know the feeling
Scottish songs with American friends 🇬🇧🇺🇸 https://t.co/OQIXgAok5j
@beth_anna123 Wonder if I can do this with my siblings 🤔😂
@beth_anna123 I said to my mum and she said she's done it a few times before but I just didn't know
That's it @charpatterson_  has convinced me I'm moving to NI!👌🏻😂
