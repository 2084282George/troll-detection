@djchloeharris @miseryconfusion @liam_o Came here for the breaks and was not disappointed ⛓
@chinchillaah @djshiva Bless u 😘
@chinchillaah I can't wait to hear all about your trip 💕✨
@liam_o Also why does it look like they're working out on the ship from Alien 😱
I wish there was a spin class where they only played drum and bass and/or breaks. That's the real key to get people to 95 rpm 💨
@Taylor_Hugs Haha yes! The drift drives me a little crazy. Good to remember that things sounds different in a loud club also.
@YoPHNK I meant recordings!
Tfw you have your first coffee of the day and believe accomplishing anything/everything is possible 💪
Tmw you Shazam a song during a juggling performance 🤹🏻‍♂️

@chinchillaah That is seriously so outrageous, I'm sorry :(

@Taylor_Hugs You set the best vibes, thank you!!!
@BabySamDeejay @tiffwanee @chinchillaah thank u for coming!!
Yesterday I overheard someone at work use the phrase "organizational hygiene" and I'm still trying to figure out wtf it means
@jelrGREEN haha, an excellent skill to have ;)
