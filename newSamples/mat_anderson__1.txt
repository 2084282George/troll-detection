the bbc's football coverage is awful
did yesterday actually happen?
tommy wright got it totally wrong today
well that was shit and depressing
first lecture cancelled on Monday following two months off, that'll do nicely
just seen the rugby score .. were we really that bad or England just too good?
@lewisdoig Gary Miller deserves a run out at right back but I can't see the captain getting dropped
Dave Mackay was absolutely shit today, and not for the first time this season.
@Mathewr0ss there's such a thing?! what's the link for it man, I might give it a go!
@juliegibson33 I don't think I've for over like 50 since haha
@juliegibson33 101, lol
got totally soaked walking round to the shop, lovely.
mannus must be gutted, shouldnt even have been sent off in the first place
Has Danny Welbeck's penalty landed yet?
if I could get my new timetable that would be great ..
@Ramallhama are you not meant to be playing fives tonight haha?
Wayne Rooney is carrying Man Utd this season
@KirstyEadie no, thankfully haha! just read about it :(
paddy :(
decent night playing fives #andystewartnumber9
got a whole two months off for christmas, loving life
getting to stirling for 9am could be fun
hate those people that stand right at the doors of a train and attempt to barge their way on when everyone is trying to get off.
ref has had a total shocker and ruined the fight.
@GlantSantana ridiculously good squad!
how can charlie adam keep getting back into the Scotland team? he's dreadful every time.
it has been far too long since I last had a dominos
just got an appeal through for business, a C up to an A .. didn't even know that was possible?!
one and a half hours my train was delayed tonight .. ONE AND A HALF.
both hibs and hearts are absolutely shite
the weather is so miserable
the amount of fun you can have with a balloon is endless
dad got a letter through the post from some random girl asking if he was her father hahahaha .. awkward
I think my room is the only room in the house that doesn't get wifi.
@Stuart_Webster mental webby.
@KirstyEadie didn't think that was possible! bet you're glad you went after all then ...
@Mathewr0ss well done mate!
love hearing all the exaggerated uni stories
@Stuart_Webster what?!?!
must be amazing to be in the Scotland support tonight
even managed to make the paper, yaaasss http://t.co/ZaixoATFaj
never swore so much in my life
last night was incredible
you doing anything today @deemboat ?
@ChloeMiddleton_ wait, mine might be working again actually!
@ChloeMiddleton_ me neither :(
can't get over how good last night was
@bengee33 you have to take it in 6th man haha, its a must!
@hala_john it's too late for me but you can still save yourself!
finally managed to learn my scottish candidate number after something like three years
why is the weather always so nice when its study leave?
@deemboat deal
why did i take higher chemistry?
@lewisdoig they were trying to drag him off the pitch haha, he was totally distraught! it was the ref's first game since november, strange..
@lewisdoig ... the second penalty shouldn't have been, he even played advantage which a dunfermilne guy missed one on one from 5yards...
Can't believe what I saw at East End Park today, the most fixed game of football I have ever witnessed. Surprised Forfar never walked off.
Advanced Modern Studies is easier than higher ..
The thought of never having another proper 6 period day of school ever again is blissful.
@gavinlogan I'll add you in the facebook message, it'll be easier!
@gavinlogan robbie laidlaw and joe higgins, then hopefully you and one other!
Get to spend a whole evening with Feron tomorrow night, what more can a boy dream of?
@deemboat http://t.co/kBfF36QkVz
I've been far too anti-social these holidays
@AndyyMcdowell at least being top of the league is achieving something, gaining top half in a shite league isn't anything special
Chelsea v Man Utd doesnt have a patch on the Forfar v Abroath at the weekend.
@JohnAnderson_94 haha, im looking forward to it!
Miller on over Rhodes?!?!
@deemboat at least i value my friends.
Playing hockey (if its on) without @hala_john wont feel the same today.
Got threatened with Balf by some wee ned with a hockey stick hahahaha
lomas must go #lomasout
#lomasout
@Davewalker95 Lomas doesn't do sensibility though haha...
@ChloeMiddleton_ #lomasout
I really don't understand Lomas.
seek for the ballboy that pulled his left hammy midway through the second half as well #prayfortheballboy
dad's so proud of starting up his own driving school company, aaw tom
my motivation for revision and homework is non-existent.
@Stuart_Webster again, give me examples then?
@Stuart_Webster examples?
@Stuart_Webster craigs deflection save at the end was good, the rest where straight at him, he 'should' save them. overall he's still shit
@Stuart_Webster @juliegibson_7 just watched the highlights, he makes 1 really good save, the rest are easy...
@juliegibson_7 i'll quite happily send you videos that prove it if you want?
@lewisdoig coincidentally, you can also fit a whale in the gap between mccracken and his man at set pieces
@lewisdoig what a goal it was! shame that'll probably be nige's only contribution for about the next month...
@lewisdoig you were right at ht, 'you can never predict what lomas will do..' then he subs michael 'iniesta' doughty.. what was that about?!
@ChrisMcCabe i'll take a listen, i love basically every song on an end has a start, i cant chose a favourite! more people need to like them!
@ChrisMcCabe have you heard the album An End Has a Start? so good!!!
@LankyGingerOne happy birthday man! hope you're having a good time in south africa and remembered the sun cream... http://t.co/Ib8WVmp4
Sergio Ramos is hugely overrated.
27 + 24 = 53, thanks for the extra two marks feron #feronprelimbanter
@Andrew_Saints12 @juliegibson_7 tade's been having 'bad games' since october/november...
Novak Djokovic is too good.
@juliegibson_7 i had a friend who was a hibs fan and used to go through with him...
Why whenever Andy Murray plays does there have to be an outbreak between Scottish patriotics and British nationalists? Just support him.
@TeQuieroMariiia if any teacher would forget it would be her haha!
Eden Hazard is a disgrace.
