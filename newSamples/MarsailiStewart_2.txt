@jen_mcgregor I was offered a ticket but it was one in its own next to one of my aunts posh friends 😖
@hicassy You know it
It's sad how excited I am for my mum to come home with food #getinmybelly
Gone from all the glamour of yesterday to wearing half soaked jeans cos I didn't have enough time to dry them, I need to reevaluate my life🙃
Seeing goths out in this weather really stresses me out, how do they not overheat?
Do all American police officers just pull out a gun and start shooting as soon as they feel threatened🤔
@NicolaSturgeon I have lived in this country all my life and all I can hope is that racism doesn't become a part of Scotland! Thank u Nic!💕
@Ashton5SOS can you move the drums to the front of the stage next time so I can see your beautiful face? https://t.co/UzN1JGPBwz
Oh how I've missed the swishing sound of salopettes
@jen_mcgregor it's okay we all make mistakes
@justinbieber "life is worth living" is literally incredible. Thank you 🙌🏻 #purpose
@CeeLoGreen dressed as a bunch of flowers is the best thing I've seen all year #XFactor
Hanging with my cats cause they're my real friends
What a weird night
The stress of this match is going to make me put on a stone of weight in one day #stresseating #AUSvSCO #RugbyWorldCup #RWC2015
Too laid back with my mates, constantly stressed out and paranoid with everyone else
So glad I invested in a spider catcher aka my cat
I've eaten too much pasta again
@_JamieStewart_ lying here laughing at my own joke like a weirdo, I'm clearly the funny sibling
Basically everything went on fire and we had to call the fire brigade and my phones on 3% battery and I have no power #wishmeluck
Just glad England lost tbh #WAL #RWC2015
I need to cuddle like 8 cats right now
Absolutely hate being ignored
You were red and you liked me cause I was blue, you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky, and you decided purple just wasn't for you 💕🎶
@MathleteBSquare I'm awake
@nsandihelp my gran is wondering what she can do with this, thought you might be able to help http://t.co/7QeN8KCA98

Going away tomorrow for the night with my best friend of 6 years before she leaves me for uni in the south of England, excited but sad 😆😔

All I do these days is sleep 😴
I'm a passion fruit that's lost its passion
@jen_mcgregor no actually I have to
Getting real fed up of people I trust fucking me over
I'm going away in like an hour and I don't think I can handle that considering I fell down the stairs in loft as soon as I arrived
