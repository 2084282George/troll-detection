It’s really, really sad to see someone continue to blame their unhappiness on other people’s actions with zero ability to self-reflect
In 2018 it would be great if my neighbors would stop getting me mixed up w/ the only other Asian woman in our build… https://t.co/OfXsMpkZfO
The recycling truck is loudly bumping Ja Rule outside my building and I’m not mad about it 📣📣📣
@djShmeeJay @redbull_radio Unfortunately not :( It’s very radio-style ephemeral

I swear, the only thing shitty male DJs find more threatening than female DJs are trans DJs. Fuck their fragile masculinity.
@BabySamDeejay That was so much fun!! Stoked to play tunes w/ ya on Saturday
@DJNHKGUY 🙏🏼💕
It me https://t.co/O9EV1YGRJQ
@liam_o Only time I've ever enjoyed the presence of a drum circle
@theRealHojo Discomfort fuels change, that's for sure
@lizmrush So true. Being kind to yourself can be a struggle, and it shouldn't be!
How 2 not cringe when listening to your own DJ sets? Inquiring minds want to know 🤔
Ok it was actually 2 songs
Family vacations are great for understanding where all your fucked up, deep-seated neuroses come from 🙃😪
@chinchillaah ❤❤❤
@chinchillaah He's a shit stain, and it's not ok! Love you, you deserve so much more ❤
Traveling with family is a good reminder of how much I truly value my gd alone time #silenceisgolden

@lizmrush w/ my current haircut I need about the same (maybe fewer??)
@chinchillaah Just feelin' nostalgic! Change is hard
@HE_VALENCIA That was unreal, lol. Dude was the most annoying person at that function, 💯
Getting older is rad because I hate myself a lot less now than I did when I was younger
Next level club vibe no one ever asked for: doing acro-yoga next to the DJ
I'm that bish who needs to Shazam top 40 tracks in the Lyft on my way to the function 🙃
@chinchillaah But he knows Tiesto! lol
@CustomsSEA @seiho777 @Kremwerk @Taylor_Hugs @MattTecson YEEEE can't wait &lt;3
