@cocogalletly97 Yes.
Mad as heck!
Some wise words, to be heeded. Listen to my LPs. Search: 'Father John Misty'. Regards.
@HOOMESHAAKE Great insights, Peter. When I myself eat “candy” for dinner, it is purgatory. Being a musician you will understand my phrasing.
@SJacobW Rest assured there are plenty of those greater than you at Tweets. Like me, FJ Misty, par example.
MAC DEMARCO is a HACK. His writing is subpar and he panders to his tweenage fanbase. Sad!
@DIY_Beds Amused. I can imagine that fraudster Bon Iver living here, for all of several seconds, before producing yet another mediocre LP.
This bih really shuffles my truffles, if you can read the label of the vinyl I'm placing on the Crosley.  https://t.co/pJ2LyXQUta
@sadlovesquotes Hah. On the condition she can appreciate Pure Comedy, for the opus which it is.
@ghostpoet Your music plays second-fiddle to mine, mate. Fans, if you would like layers, look only to FJ Misty.
I Love You, Honeybear out now https://t.co/FLW9oLCZWH
What do you call a three legged donkey? A wonkey.
If anyone spoilers The Last Jedi for me, I won’t be making any more albums.
@hannahislost Listen to my new LP, Hannah. It always works wonders for me.
@BoxyShip6433 We both know I meant to say no such thing. He is not a music nerd. A music nerd would appreciate the artistry of my creation.
Oh great, that fool of a music journalist has his fans following me.
@theneedledrop No. Either buy on cassette or don't buy the music at all.
@theneedledrop Please don't patronise me, we're both bigger than that. At least I am. Judging by what score you gave ILYHb, I'm not so sure.
You're all fools.
@efrazable @peeznuts The proof, Ethan, not that I should be dignifying any of this with a response. https://t.co/kJCYiykkQ1
@morvynholmes @jasonsherrit99 I'm not familiar with your British vernacular, but the New Musical Express have it a 9 score.
@Msldemarco You inspired a generation to take up smoking, I inspired them to reevaluate themselves. Who's the better musician?
Okay, impromptu AMA.
@missxbe Listen to I Love You, Honeybear. Sure to melt away the stress, Eilidh.
@kirstenclark_ Whenever I feel like that, I just put on one of my albums. I Love You, Honeybear is as good a place as any to start.
@BeEsLeY14 I Love You, Honeybear. Reprobate.
@jasonsherrit99 Did you listen to my new album, yet?
@beliebnbieber__ No, he's not. Father John Misty is.
@Roxanaxox They should idolise Father John Misty, agreed?
@emilyhastings_ You would have been better served listening to one of my albums, Emily.
@_bethanymcginnx My album can take you to the North Pole, Beth, and so much more. You can feed the Honeybears instead.
@applevampires Macbriare is a reprobate, Catherine. He doesn't even play music. Listen to my latest album, and let the music take you.
@TannerMillis18 Yes, I do. I do.
@peeznuts You mustn't be a music fan. Never mind, carry on.
@peeznuts Have you ingested my newest piece yet? It's called I Love You, Honeybear.
@rsoetyler @kaIindasharmas @emiliafoxy @jennacoIeman Have any of you been blessed with my new album?
@fivepastthree Thank You, Annie. Regards, J. Tilman.
