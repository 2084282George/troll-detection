@nah_solo I sense a story idea: We Spent €900 To See Kylie Minogue Play At Berghain And They Didn't Even Let Us In
Well shit now I wish I purchased some tickets to this https://t.co/PlinK8WvAS
@ShawnReynaldo My FB feed is full of this. I've been thinking about writing a long, diary-like post about my feelings about it.
@AngstromHoot Speaking from a Berlin perspective, it’s still quarantined. When Eleganza was here, it was at Janus,… https://t.co/Ery8fe6Vfz

@Ember_ebooks Duh?
@lufthansa How do I change a cancelled flight from Munich-&gt;Berlin into a Deutsche Bahn ticket online?
@mhgbrown I think they're getting stricter tbh.
@c__mm Whoa. Never heard of it. I will peep, thx.
@c__mm But which one did your dream friends say was the best?
@brandonhaslegs I think that involves bidets.
@MATRiXXMAN Glad to hear everything worked out. Where did you land?
@ShawnReynaldo It's a special word reserved only for the lowest of the low.

@timelessmixes I can't see the mixes but is one of these the BR with Josh Milan? I saw him and Louie in New York and it was awesome.
You've got a convertible, two of your best friends, and a destination. What's your soundtrack? Read more on @EBnet: https://t.co/TcrfGeix4p
It's been known to happen. https://t.co/R3xBwyNprV
Overheard in a New York elevator, “The Chipotle just isn’t as good out here.”
@willfewell All my out of town friends thought it was a record store for so long.
@ShawnReynaldo Aw, too bad. No, in NYC for other reasons.
Last night I watched Grace Jones blow out the candles on her birthday cake. Her performance before was great too.

@ShawnReynaldo @twitter Is this like FarmersOnly but for Americans in Spain?

But an underpopulated Berghain is a much more enjoyable experience on the dancefloor.
Some more thoughts on the weekend: Skatebärd &amp; Benji DF at Sameheads were amazing, and I usually hate that venue. So many choice italo cuts
Wind - "Luxury" https://t.co/P2iZ0xsMrk
@MATRiXXMAN Can I get that as a preset or something?
@mhgbrown And yet that still seems more reasonable than emails you have to login to unsubscribe from.

I'd feel self-conscious about inviting people to a party I'm djing at if free pizza wasn't also somehow involved. https://t.co/vIH1SD5kqD

San Francisco looks like a way more fun and deviant city back then.

@timelessmixes I'll admit it's not my favorite version, but I'm embracing the mellow Kuniyuki post-party atmospheric feeling this evening.
@timelessmixes Word. I'm just throwing out ideas.
@timelessmixes I like 44gs, but only for the tracking. White Labels sounds good, but it's the same as an ortofon basically.

@timelessmixes I’m talking about Harv, not Cloutier. I’ve enjoyed Cloutier’s sets at Berghain, but they’re nothing exceptional for the venue
@timelessmixes Like all DJs he has the capacity for screwing up occasionally. But when he’s on he’s on, and he has a really defined sound.
@timelessmixes I was feeling pretty bummed out on DJs too, but then I heard Harvey at Mighty last weekend and all was right with the world.
I think I’m going to vote for this guy instead of Vermin Supreme next year. “We are Americans, we can do.” https://t.co/TfGK1jkiCa

@timelessmixes It'd have to be an amazing track that somehow used it's lo-finess to get around the jarring awfulness of 192
@timelessmixes I'm pretty much at a point where lossy content is as good as dead to me. Give me FLAC or nothing.
@timelessmixes Sounds Norwegian...
@timelessmixes Same for the most part. But the variety and depth on this one did it for me:  https://t.co/ixMEk548Ij
It's comforting to know that Santa Cruz public access is still running barely coherent documentaries about the Brotherhood of Eternal Love

@blackmadonnachi @avalon_emerson Further proof that if you can think of something, it's probably already been done by somebody at Panorama.
@timelessmixes Entertainment industries always attract the best and brightest...
@timelessmixes Jokes on you: When I get there, I'll have made a name for myself as a "trainwreck mixer" and it'll all be a part of my shtick
@timelessmixes The Urei is magical because it's simple. No channel EQs, extra gain knobs or split cue — only pots with an unbeatable curve.
All of these Twitter bots keep favoriting a tweet from a sock puppet complaining about a party at Harlot that I didn't write about...
Engrossed in the strange world of eBay Kleinanzeigen wheeling and dealing.
@brandonhaslegs What map service is this?
And the award for "Best DJ Set Performed While Seemingly Blackout Drunk" goes to...Jamie 3:26 last night at Berghain Kantine!
Kind of on the line between @PanoBarMusic &amp; that "Tracks you haven't heard in Panorama Bar" FB group.
It doesn't get much better than a relaxed Sunday afternoon session at Berghain with friends.
Latest Cybernedits from @avalon_emerson is out. It's got everything from Bjork to Blackjack. It's dope. It's free: http://t.co/W1gO60JsN3
@HunchMusic Such a great (and slept on, I guess?) cut. Like modern Penguin Cafe Orchestra.
@HunchMusic Vibing on your pre-party excitement. Post more tunes.
