@sophieKsunberg Twitter gives you 280 characters and you still try to squeeze out the end of that tweet there
@Bethmackinnon7 In your opinion, yes you could say that. But I’m still gonna day you’ve always been insane
@arran_black @kathryntatlowx Ugh. Now you’re the joke

@charpatterson_ But it’s a lovely song
@kathryntatlowx That’s my secondary reason
@kathryntatlowx Ain’t that bad cause it’s a lot easier to make it with water
@yellalongbottom @kathryntatlowx Now this is called bullying so I’m gonna report you
@jacko200118 I mean it’s a lot better than a double hammy cramp😂

@kathryntatlowx Aye and I’m one of them
@kathryntatlowx Clearly
@kathryntatlowx It finished quite a while ago mate, get your facts right
