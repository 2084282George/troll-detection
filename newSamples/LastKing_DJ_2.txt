I really hope people can keep up the political revolution that the referendum started. Don't give up now.
The things guys are attracted to and the things girls think guys are attracted to are so different it's hilarious.
I swear there's guys I know that are more into drake than any female.
It's weird that because of tinder the first time your "true love" sees your face might be while they're sitting on the toilet. #LoveInTheLoo
Am I excited about college? No. Am I excited about these saas payments? Yes.
@joanne_poyner my twitter doesn't give me notifications -.- but yeah come down! Text me!
There's a sniffer dog in queen street station and it's barking at like every 3rd person. I'm sure most of them need to change their pants.

I HATE WHEN PEOPLE TYPE LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME
Screw it. I'm saying I saw smurfs 2
Glute attack
Kinda wondering what name I'll call kickass 2 when my strict Christian parents ask what I saw at the cinema. Any suggestions? Kickbutt maybe

Just to update anyone who cares, I'm moving to Glasgow on the 25th now :)
Some girls should not wear leggings. Pass the eye soap please.
Heading to my college induction with like no sleep. Ain't nobody got time for that @CofGcollege
Whenever I'm around someone who hates me I can never stop smiling or laughing. Ha ha my life sucks slightly less than yours
That moment of joy and relief when you realize it was just a bad dream.
Sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny, hurricane, sunny.

Everyone should come hang out at the best coffee shop in Perth :) 274 Old High Street
@space_kidet @GregorBanks just ain't tired lol
@GregorBanks I'm flat broke till midnight tomorrow but I'll come to the shop anyway
Heard on the news that a little girl had her intestines sucked out of her by a pool drain. Another reason why I don't go swimming.
Some idiots. #mcdonalds #bike #drivethru #goodluck http://t.co/3LrCQvg1Zo
Ever had one of those days where you just wanna be a potato sleeping peacefully in the ground?
If you're a girl and you snapchat me with no makeup on then I know we're real friends lol
@Spurdyy I wish! I'm so confused lol
I'm gonna start eating healthier...tomorrow.
My day has consisted of tasting all these drinks so I can describe them to customers. #coffee #tasting… http://t.co/Pt1lrnvWbj

Read the white letters. #truth http://t.co/EmnyjN6abL
Who wants to be my thunder buddy?
Some people are so needy, it's okay to be on your own, you don't need someone attached to your hip 24/7.
Haha the new DC animated movie has a black president that sounds like Barack. #toocool
I'm so sleepy I'm sitting down to pee. #girlstyle
I've been sitting here too long, they're gonna think I'm crapping lol
I'm going stir crazy at work. As soon as I get outta here I'm getting naked on the inch.
I'm always afraid I'm gonna meet someone who can read my thoughts cuz they'll probably punch me
I'm introducing my 3yr old niece to all the old good cartoons. Right now: Samurai Jack
I love warm nights
@HR_Clark no
FYI, we can all tell you're sucking your stomach in, those pics ain't fooling anybody
That dude in glee died from heroin and alcohol. It's sad and all but I'm not surprised he needed drugs to be on that show.
I love US Netflix.
If I get another T in the park snapchat I'm just gonna have to slap someone.
It's not even 10am and my niece is already bugging me to take her to the park. Anyone wanna babysit a 3yr old? I'll pay you in skittles?
@HR_Clark like royalty as always ;) lol
@HR_Clark not offensive at all...
I'll probably never want to go to T in the park.
Not everyone is naturally in shape. Some of us actually exercise and eat junk food once or twice a week instead of once or twice a day.
Sleeves rolled up cuz it's toasty weather. http://t.co/hZKdU3LQ56
Anyone at the inch?
If your life had a face I would punch it
