@FutbolReece @FullTimeDEVILS Neither can Pogba?
@Matt_Santangelo @GCaltabanis I think he started well too. I liked him at first, but after a while people learned how to play against him
@Matt_Santangelo @GCaltabanis would you take Darmian?

@Turner_LFC cheaper sometimes better Lanzini is the man!
Liverpool have banned the Sun from covering their matches and press conferences. About time!
On paper our team should be challenging for the league in reality I really doubt that we'll make top 4.
Come on United, where is the desire, at this rate we are not going to get Champions league. All big teams yet to play this year.
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Gerrard won one Champions League
Wes Brown won two http://t.co/JES0zHfA2y
Atletico 1-0 Real Madrid

Here's a short and unbiased piece I wrote a while back on City

Enjoy.

About to order some replica AAA United home shirts ¬£30 
Who wants one? Sizes?
There is something seriously wrong if we fail to win the F.A cup this year, easiest chance we'll have for years http://t.co/T3fvHR0vQG
I think people who know nothing about football will blame Falcao for not scoring today, no service to him whatsoever, midfield fault
Man Utd XI against Cambridge: 
De Gea, Jones, Rojo, Blind, Valencia, Carrick, Fellaini, Januzaj, Di Maria, Wilson, Falcao. #MUFC
JAMES WILSONS GOAL https://t.co/rheEfWRxOM
Me when we play 3-5-2 
https://t.co/7pSsdHESXP
Don't get why people debate about why Januzaj isn't playing obviously doesn't fit into the formation, if we played wingers he would start
Juan Mata is one of the best people to have at our club, great ambassador and true gentleman, always stays behind to sign autographs
@RedStarLvrpool yh I was thinking that
Ronaldo: "SAF told me to keep improving all the time. He said: 'Cristiano, you're the best, don't worry about the rest. I miss him"
Fully Deserved. Only one winner. Only one CR7 üôå http://t.co/UQITeqPzPT
Ronaldo taking pictures with some fans http://t.co/5ZcdCDoJe0
Paul Pogba: "I was impatient, I didn't want to wait. But I will not speak ill of Manchester United. I love the club."
Which is MORE to blame?
RT - Substitutions made 
FAV - Formation played
What a Very disappointing result. That was a bad performance and deserved by Southampton. We need to play better!
FFS! Step it up United!
Quite a boring first half. We need to pick up the tempo!
I've got a really good feeling about today! COME ON UNITED!!
Team news coming soon. Stay tuned. Who do you want to see start?
Van Gaal is very happy https://t.co/Zq4py0CHsF (@vonstrenginho)
Morgan Schneiderlin: "When you look at Rooney, Di Mar√≠a, van Persie and Falcao, it's scary."
It's Match Day! Come on United! #MUFC http://t.co/NHRh53Jdma
Everyone should sing "David De Gea, We want you to stay" tomorrow at OT 

RT TO HELP AND GET EVERYONE TO SING IT http://t.co/eiK29a33Kb
Liverpool have been turned down twice in the same day Valdes would rather be a Sub keeper and Shaqiri would rather be in mid table in Italy
De Gea is on ¬£75k a week whilst Valdes is on ¬£90k a week http://t.co/r5ZyuGQzlr
Our form during our 'bad patch' this season üê∏‚òïÔ∏è

WWWWWWDWDDW
Gerrard is class but people saying he's the best prem midfielder of all time are deluded not even the best Eng Prem player, Scholes is.
'Gerrard lived his Childhood dream by playing for Liverpool' üëè http://t.co/f30N47fKga
First Balotelli now Rodgers #Scumbags http://t.co/2YHr7XEnh0
Did city fans not get the memo, Halloween is long gone so why are they still dressing up as blue chairs http://t.co/OTUfFjMZxP
What the fuck is Jonny Evans doing
LOL http://t.co/OCyhnldH30
We need to get some consistently in the team, the same starting eleven, playing in the same formation, doesn't seem like it is ever going to
Come on Newcastle !!!
Just offer De Gea a 6-year contract with ¬£200k a week he's one of our most important players and will be best keeper in the world one day
Not Arrogant, Just Better. http://t.co/S8PAMQs1Ek
@JmeBBK @KSIOlajidebt @Behzinga Where's @DoYouWantSome_  credit Ksi ?
I pray to god that we don't play 3-5-2
David De Gea has backed out of the Spain squad through injury, it's said that he has Broken a finger. üò©
Aguero has signed a 40 years contract at Man City!! http://t.co/Byo2LQB3gp
At the end of the day we played against the Champions at their ground, with 10 men, our best striker was injured, and they were on the ropes
I think we would have won the game with all men on the field, but anyone can say that. They do say it's harder against 10 men sometimes.
The thing is Smalling didn't need to make that Challenge, he should have just run him down the line
They want to expand their Stadium. And they think Manchester is blue. Give me a break. http://t.co/44caZL4PIc
Yesss Costa isn't playing!
Mike dean http://t.co/tQ1K3A4OmF
Premier League this season

Fellaini 1
Balotelli 0
HOLY SHITCAKES FELLAINI
Januzaj's agent: "We know the club is very happy with him and they want to keep Adnan for the rest of his career." http://t.co/hqGi21oazx
Rafael: "I love my life here (at United). I've been here almost 10 years now. I'm almost a mancunian. I want to stay here, if they want me."
Happy Birthday Duncan Edwards! He would have been 78 today. Lest we Forget #MUFC http://t.co/XzVbjOVuA1
Who do you think is player of the month I'd say Herrera been consistent throughout http://t.co/LH93ng5TBT
