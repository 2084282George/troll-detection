Just got rapped at by a 🤷‍♀️ rapper in ktown who didn't know his own lyrics. 🤦🏾‍♂️
@defsound how am I just seeing this. lol.
@EstyOficial It does exist. I'm going to play your music on a future episode of @expeditionradio on @dashradio. Fou… https://t.co/iyycmzBZ0u
@raihan_ All good. Wouldn't be surprised. Jonah was the MD for his Blue Whale record release show. But yeah, you answered my question.
@raihan_ Lol, yeah. We have great dead jazz here that they've overlooked. 🤷‍♀️
When you've prioritized recognition over your craft, you've lost.
@KONNYKON_ @okayplayer @sollaaay @mndsgn Check it now.

@QuintonBrock_ go to Europe. You can come to LA anytime.
Thank you to all the creatives who let me work w them in some capacity. 

This was a massive growing year. 🙏🏾
@JoyTheDrummer was that last year when Mononeon &amp; Cory Henry played?
@shomipatwary trash is an aesthetic.
@DolfinRecords so prolific it's hard to keep up w all their releases.
@NiceGuyxVinny I was late myself. SoundCloud is useless now besides unofficials and bootlegs. Spotify has helped out a lot.
@SenayKenfe is that your club?
@defsound @Ms_Jck "awfully hot coffee pot" surely counts as a white thought. 🤷‍♀️
