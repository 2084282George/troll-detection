@Campaign4Bernie I will pass this on to the mother.she is emailing the Senator as well. I'm sure a personal response from him might help
@Campaign4Bernie   I would be interested to know how you determined that. As you can imagine, it was quite a shock for a grieving mom.
@Campaign4Bernie tks 4the reply. SOMEONE supporting him did this. It's sad and I thought the Senator should know. Definitely not his values
@AnneAbsalom @BernieSanders it's a building in Belleville NJ where she had memorial painted 4her son. Drove by this morning and saw graffiti
