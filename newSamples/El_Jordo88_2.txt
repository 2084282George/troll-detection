@SubClub hey. I've taken my friend's e-ticket (3-tickets) as she isn't going anymore, and it has her name on it. Will we be able to get in?
@jackmaster Any chance of a wee bit of help? What's a typical licensing period for an electronic label releasing a producer's track? 3 yrs?
@jet2tweets Hi. I won free return flights in Nov. I added my partner to booking, just noticed I have never received my confirmation email.
@midlandsound Good day! Can you be of assistance, wise sage?  I'm hoping their description rings bells, it has me i… https://t.co/xuSaSVKY6n
Great day at the #ukmusic event at @UofGlasgow. Thanks to everyone involved. @barrientosmusic session was quality, cheers!

@BwanaBeats Yo Bwana! The Studio B's are great. Currently studying Music Business with a view to going the electronic route. Big help! Thx👌🏼
@SkyHelpTeam Hi. Are there any known issues in the Glasgow area? Internet working until about 15mins ago. Thanks.
@FromThemDepths Been having that issue with label names. My imagination is kaput.
@deaco2000 haha how the fuck did you get verified?
@barrydiscotec Buchanan St via Colombo.
@GlasgowJives seems to have been cleared now.
@Muzzle86 @Coldwar_Steve https://t.co/UYGdN9jOx0
@YodelOnline Hi, my parcel was not delivered due to my intercom system not working. I'd taken today off work for the delivery. No phonecall?
@SubClub No probs. Will be a special Juan!
@bhoysabroad @90MinuteCynic Double BOC is fine with me!
Craigan using the term "worldie". Cringey. #celticalloa
@boilerroomtv @innrvsns haha My bad. Point still stands.
All the #Dekmantel16 posts...It's too much to take 😫
@Lone @adityashekr @boctransmission Make it so BOC https://t.co/jCisGWiind
@bhoysabroad Just finished listening guys. Really enjoyed that one. TMBTP to finish just tops up the good vibes! HH.
@Barcabhoy1 @HoopsmanB If we get through I think Anderlecht would be an OK draw. Fair few ones I'd want to avoid there though!
@Ginty1888 @90MinuteCynic haha C'mon you! Has to improve the end product.
@90MinuteCynic Great to hear some new Aphex Twin! A fine accompaniment to the football chat.
@MDembele_10 YES! Welcome!
Scotland leaves the UK(IP) and rejoins the EU. Sound cunts rejoice and head north of the border. Amiright!? #EUref #Remain
"Take Back Control" mantra starting to sound a bit cult-like now.  #BBCDebate
Romania happy to sit for the point here #EURO2016
Techno DJs need to stop the blurred face promo pics. Enough.
Constant "gym" conversation of colleagues is so tedious. I know this gym fad must be a good thing but all about image rather than health.
@lomalitomoala Poland.
@RinseFM @BAKEGLA G41👌🏽
@jujujordash Help a brother out...
@SullivanSK Goosebumps at that btw!
@palmstrax Had to be the weekend I'm working. Welcome and ENJOY! 👌🏼

@codeinedrums Same!
@boilerroomtv @Auntie_Flo Well, that one went OFF! Come back again.
New @MStimming album 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
@barrydiscotec Good mate, how are you? Saturday will be great fun!
@ModeratOfficial Amazing last night. Glasgow knows how to do it!!
@CHVRCHES That was fucking amazing! Had a bickering couple behind us (seating) for ages beforehand. Both bouncing away by the end.
Had a dream last night that I was at a @boctransmission/@mogwaiband gig. 

Why hasn't this happened and what do we need to do to make it so?
@Loganat0r Welcome to Glasgow! Thoroughly enjoyed that although sadly couldn't attend! Cheers 👌🏼
@alexsmoke *Amazon

Interchangeable.
@alexsmoke Not enough blimps in Glasgow, I feel.
@Debenhams Hi, do you have a number for the Urban Decay counter at your Silverburn, Glasgow store?
New @ModeratOfficial  😍

#reminder
Armstrong should be nowhere near that #Celtic team tonight.
@kangertech Yet another Kanger Subtank leaking. Unimpressed.
@90MinuteCynic What has prompted the shift from Dundee to Scandinavia in terms of scouting? Is this a sign Deila is finally getting his way?
@palmstrax @Ollie_Cocris Absolutely spewing at missing the night. However, the latest "Cooking With..." is slowly numbing the disappointment
@codeinedrums @BenjaminDamage On it! That will do nicely.
