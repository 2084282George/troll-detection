When you accidently tap too quick and the snapchat disappears into the dark void of snapchats I have missed seeing.
When I'm definitely looking at someone first and they look back at me and then I cut them with a dirty look. #london

The Hillsong LDN Accounts Team are currently being graced with Where You Are on loop. Thanks @hillsongyandf for making Monday's fun.
@LauraCoops19 oh okay yeh best to keep it safe and avoid bucks as much as possible 😕😂
Faith is something you have, and trust is a moment in which you use it.
If you think you're not good enough to receive a compliment then you're thinking about yourself too much
I definitely could have got an early night tonight. But here we are.
I wonder if as big a deal was made about Jesus' birthday before he became king of the world
Why is it always at 11pm that the desire to clean my room strikes?
@jadegellenseast plain rice then?
@IshaVictoria or @TomasCanning 😉
Dreams attract teams. Cast a new vision with your team today. #leadership
Fair to say, I will not be buying anything from said shop.
I think this is a shop that my dad might quite like.

Waited for 50 minutes and counting for my meal at the local Wetherspoon's. @jdwtweet is this good enough? #wetherspoon #denmarkhill
@bequietamy trust meeeee.
Mercy triumphs over judgement
Still bought them though.
£1.99 for a tube of Pringles is a 'special price'? Specially a rip off is what it is.

Why does this train smell of chicken? It's 8.15am
Regardless of it being one of the worst tasting milk drinks ever created by man.
Here in Your presence, Lord I surrender,
To Your glory, for Your glory.
@bequietamy "it's who I am"
You know that #SF15 is less than a week away when your Saturday alarm has been set for 6am.
In one of this moods where just everything annoys you for no reason.
Leaving home at 17 has taken its toll. I'm almost certain my insides have died due to poor diet.
@AndGloTweets do you think he was guilty? I didn't follow the whole trial but was surprised at the outcome.
I've been emotionally unstable for 8 consecutive days, this can't be healthy.
Transfixed by the definition of the big screen at waterloo station. It's incredible.
@janeshepherd_x it's incredible. The band were signing at Conference on Wednesday and it was 💯
Bank of Scotland really need to invest in some waiting music on their Customer Care line. Listening to ringing for 10 minutes solid.
@Niran7 I enjoy snapchat for jokes between friends but nothing else. And trust me, periscope is never going on my phone lool
I keep thinking about Mathias leaving and it makes me want to cry

The distinct smell of cigarettes, both past and present, lingered in the air
Be kind 😌
Grief turning into anger over the #CharlestonShooting 
Praying for all those affected.

It's cute how people try to cover it up by saying it's better for everyone but in reality don't think past the end of their nose
People protesting about Tories 😂😂😂 u cast your vote and didn't win, that's what happens BYE 👋👋👋
@Scottiebowtie looool it was great, one even pronounced ego as 'egg-o' due to the original Latin being as such
Two schoolboys arguing Latin derivatives on the train. Welcome to South West London everybody

@RadioClydeNews @mrsbiffy extremely worried about the lack of coffee in that video
@AriosoCalore it better! Otherwise I feel cheated.
@AriosoCalore it all felt rather anti-climaxial. A sticker would have been appreciated.
Feeling ready to vote for the first time today.
