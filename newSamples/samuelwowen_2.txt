@megabusuk thanks for getting into Birmingham Hill Street an hour late
@megabusuk terrible service yet again. Where is the 8:30 coach from LDN - BHAM HILL STREET? How can you be late every single time?
@Se_Railway Hope you guys made a killing today at Swanley station fining those who can't afford it trying to get home from work. Fuck you.
@megabusuk queuing up for it now, thanks
@megabusuk 45 mins late and still waiting, every time on BIR-LDN service, not good enough man
