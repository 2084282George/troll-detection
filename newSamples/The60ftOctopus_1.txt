@jessica16_x Try clean out the lint with a paperclip? Also try a different charger if you can.

Well, @muse 'Thought Contagion' is definitely better than Dig Down. Still some really suspect lyrics though.
Roses are red. 
Violets are blue.
West Brom sacked the board
But kept Alan Pardew.

Throwing my 2 pence in... That is absolutely the worst R/L lineup ever. Not even Kendrick can save the atrocity. #readingfestival
@HurricaneHic147 I'm honestly beyond fed up.

@kateyam89 @OfficialFPL (Not ignoring you on purpose... üëÄ) Football in general went well for me this weekend.

@tonilou_ With that attitude we might actually win.

@ollyog Slightly baffling though because film and TV series are challenging audiences more than ever before too

Took a punt on watching Brigsby Bear on the flight home. Glad I did.  One of my favourite films of the year.
Back from Orlando today üò™ Flight of Passage and The Forbidden Journey - wow. What incredible rides and achievements.

@CrisoWBA I think I agree. When Huddersfield are scoring 4 and we can't even score as many in a month... we don't deserve to be in the PL.
