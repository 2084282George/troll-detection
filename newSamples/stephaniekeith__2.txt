The thought of going back to work tomorrow is killing me 😣

Trying to find the motivation to get out of bed and get ready for tonight
When your boyfriend cares more about his 2 cars and motorbike than you 🙃

Sad to be coming home today but had an amazing time in Fuerteventura ☀️ https://t.co/BCDpojS12G
@ArnoldClark honestly what a joke, I wish I could go back to 3 weeks ago and get my old car back. Instead I don't have any car now 😩
Want to be beach body ready but all I can think about is chicken nuggets
Honestly don't want to move from my bed today 😴
Praying for good weather this weekend 🙏
Should probably get an early night for work tomorrow but what fun is that when I can binge watch a new tv series on Netflix 💁
Paid last week and already counting down the days to pay day..
Why can't I get a decent courtesy car 😩
I'm so ready for it to be 5pm 😴
How can I manage to spend £47 on clothes on my lunch break 😭
Some people are total dicks, some guy indicating left goes straight through a red light not even turning left nearly hitting me, asshole!
@phatneil got a job at Toni and Guy 😁
Came back from kavos and made everyone ill, sorry guys! 🙊
Herds steak pies for lunch, can't go wrong there! 😍
Spooning with Tasmin in the back if the polo 😘
Going to miss having sex on the beach cocktail when I leave kavos, it's my new favourite drink!
Actually so excited less than 24 hours I'll be in kavos!!! 😝
I drink far to much orange lucozade, it's an addiction!
Just have to get through today and tomorrow at work then I'm off for 2 weeks 🙌
I'm away home into a cold shower and putting shorts on afterwards! 👌
Just have the sudden urge to go shopping, let me out of work! 😢
Absolutely roasting feel like I'm abroad! ☀️
It's actually nice waking up on a Sunday not hungover 😊
Although that does mean cooking tea for myself 😳 #LazyPeopleProbs
Only 2 weeks and I'll be away to Kavos! 👌❤️
There's so many pretty clothes but I have so little money to buy them 😢
Would someone bring me juice please? 🙏
@zoerennie_ no problem, anytime! 😘

Someone come looking after me, got to much of a headache to work 😭
I was actually so tempted to just stay in bed 😴
Can't believe I'm onto my 3rd iphone since December 🙊
Getting my hair done today at work! 👌
Do people come in the hairdressers to just moan? 😒
Going for a run and dropped my phone and cracked the screen, good one Steph! 👍😂
Can someone bring me food and juice please? 🙏
I've been working in the salon for nearly 3 years I think I know how to do my job! 😠
I come out with such stupid things sometimes 😂
I think maybe I should revise for my theory driving test oh Thursday
Wanted to stay in Edinburgh 😔
First day of my week off I can sleep in as long as I want and I'm up at this time, what even! 😒

Do I look like a bloody painter? No!!! 😠
Think I just might sit in the sun!
What's with the fireworks?
Waking up to a mass of texts and missed calls after a night out is actually quite scary to think what has been said 😂
Seriously this rain needs to stop before I go out!
Why can't I find anything to wear for tonight 😭
@PortsMin aww yay! 😁
