@DJTrevorNelson @Stormzy1 Woke up to the news... it's not America, it was all done before 10pm! You ain't that old yet
@tarren_hartland You saw the sweat pants too
@iamEmmaLou I'd buy a house with you
Returning to London can be really dystopian. It's more chilling and brutal than warm and fuzzy
@LawlessYo After party junkie. Pls don't comment
The curling is way to tense for this hangover
Also I've only got a one way flight booked so if anyone wants to take me back to London from Glasgow on Sunday that would be nice
If there's one thing I've learned in 2018 it's that I really hate making sensible decisions
Men's curling against Canada is tense right now
@ChrisPJGodfrey I've never seen a marvel film before and loved it, so absolutely nothing
Might start an emergency touch up station at the tree
30 mins into the rugby and only just noticed England have scored 2 tries...
@purenift Haha can't believe it actually happened
@NickBrightDJ @1Xtra @BBC6Music @Offthesubsbench a printer IN the studio. How the other half live
I'd like to thank all my friends on my ongoing quest to not be a mess https://t.co/QmOOvdw2y2
@daisyjarrett @sean__od I just hope she does the radio slave remix of slow... then radio slave remixes of all her other songs
@LawlessYo What are you after? Your tweets have sucked all day

Never be that girl in the chip shop that's 'I hate fries' then orders a large fries
Soz if you identify as a person but I hate all people
@basic_john_ Maybe but it's so worth it
@aaronzimbra then you left the country
Sad if you woke up from a 12 year coma and top 8 friends is now top 9 pictures of you looking exactly the same
@joe_plumb what you doing tonight?
The best thing about having a birthday event and not telling anyone it was a birthday event is that you don't get the endless drop out texts
@aaronzimbra Exclusive dubplate bbz
@dsuperstore Bring butterscotch and pretzel cookies and I might play you a track (I won't)

@LawlessYo @actualjack @iamEmmaLou @loose__c The come down hallucinations were tough, I was even made to doubt myself about there existence
@actualjack @LawlessYo @iamEmmaLou @loose__c The amount of times I've been to co-op in chance they were back. I almost gave up all hope
@iamEmmaLou @LawlessYo @loose__c You can eat them more than once though
@LawlessYo @iamEmmaLou @loose__c They actually exist and are not kit kats. Alex you chose the worst day to leave for holiday
My greatest achievement of 2018 is finally owning enough towels that I have an allocated guest towel. I'm doing great
@LMGM If it involves an espresso martini it's a cause for celebration
@purenift I feel like I should walk away with a certificate of cleanliness
@purenift They were playing really shit generic 'deep' house. The toilets were Japanese style though with a bum spray
The smell of cheap cologne is really ruining the illusion of wealth though. There are a lot of try hard dates here
Got 13 mozzarella sticks in my box of 12 and I can't decide whether I should play the lottery or if I'm going to die today
@loose__c Drink responsibly
@joeparry Hang out with @LawlessYo and I on a Friday and we'll do a live show for you
@joeparry Drama? I thought you were just after some smut
@aaronzimbra That tweet was sponsored by cider™
@purenift I've got the sane and sorted thing in the bag (... for 3 hours a week max)
I really enjoy skin tight jeans
@aaronzimbra wu-tang made some great ones
@LawlessYo What placing ecg pads on Nick Jonas's chest?
Or three attempts at posting a mundane tweet. I'm going offline for the rest of the night
@aaronzimbra @LawlessYo Pretty sure he wasn't paying for anything under £10 either
@joeparry s.q.u.a.d.
Amazing read on the 80s London club scene and the early days of house music https://t.co/GGk6YfwWF2
@Errorfied @LawlessYo You don't want to know what he did
@joeparry i've never had a problem with topman skinny jeans
@jamesrbuk @LawlessYo soz! Gave everyone on the Victoria line southbound platform a good show
My favourite new Friday hobby is having overly dramatic arguments with @LawlessYo in tube stations
@aaronzimbra You love those kind of nights
I have 62 minutes to make it to Peckham McDonalds from Oxford street. Good luck everyone

So we're agreed the lesbian equivalent of a Daddy is a Carol Vorderman
@NickBrightDJ @1Xtra @Not3sofficial @WeLuvRobbie It's only been out a minute, how quick are you???!
Tbf I'm only really in it for ZZ Top circa 1970 nudes
FYI if you work in radio and think you're good at editing audio, there are drag queens in east London coming for your gig
What ever happened to sue011 though?
@loose__c I mean we could do that irl
2018 is definitely year of the hangover
@rrrosco It's alright babe, here for when you want to recapture your youth
I'm all for a selection box but 1am is not the time
Seriously who goes to Instagram and actually searches '#instagay'???

@LawlessYo ?
i just got the glitter out and instantly regretted it
In the pub and don't know if 'You Don't Know Me' is playing or it's the original body language and I'm hearing the vocal in my head
You know when you're amazed by basic things? I just had my mind blown by the fact that N comes before O in the alphabet
@Dobbyx3 @Reece_Parkinson Umm don't know what you guys are talking about https://t.co/w2Uz63GcqJ
@loose__c End of year list
