The amount of money people will spend on alcohol tonight to not even remember it actually makes me feel sick
Its crazy how excited I am to come off social media for the next month or two!Maybe I'll actually start to read more and also get more sleep
This is now the 2nd day my dad had put a dvd on and has fallen asleep not even half way through it 🙄
