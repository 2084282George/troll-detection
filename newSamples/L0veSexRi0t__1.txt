@RobinoTheAlbino They are such a gift
There's post gig depression then there's post download fest depression which is 100 times worse
The fact that Letlive broke up actually makes me kinda sad

Finally done with uni before Christmas can chill without feeling guilty again
I think Black Friday period in Edinburgh is my definition of hell
It's so sad, my heart in your hands, I melt like the snow in the part where you dance

Somehow I always knew
Iâ€™d bite the curb out spills the proof
I mean I've lived in my new flat for almost a month and this is the first time I've locked myself out... That's something

I love people who have amazing laughs and are not afraid to let it out
@RobinoTheAlbino it was RTd don't worry haha
This whole sleep deprivation thing is fun and all but it can stop at any time now
Try to tear us apart but know that we'll wear our scars
I wish my ex could just tone down her crazy that'd be great
@ffsiona it's not a phase Iona ;)
I really didn't want to like the new ghostbusters but ... I kinda loved it
It's nice being away from reality for a while
Sudden realisation that I will have had 5 months off of uni and have done fuck all with it ...
Forsaken, I walk the night alone
No sanctuary
No place for me to call my home
Genuinely really excited to go home and see the family this weekend
Her lipstick stains like acid rain
Dissolving away my sense of restraint
The streetlamps burned through the cloak of the fog
I know sometimes
It's gonna rain
But baby, can we make up now
Cause I can't sleep through the pain
If you don't dog your dog you will cat - hahha thank you Claude
