I don’t remember the last day I wasn’t hungover
Isn't it funny that the only person who can make you feel at your best, is the same person who makes you feel your worst ?
Having the old Snapchat back has genuinely made my week ❤️
See when a do something wrong, a admit it but see when I’m getting abuse for something I’ve no done, that fucking crossed the line
There’s honestly nothing better than walking your dog when you feel like Shit
Restarted my phone and now got the new snapchat - a hate it:)
Imagine acc saying happy birthday to someone for them to patch it, rudest thing in the world
Fed up with ignorant people ❌
Heavy breathers freak me out
Tuesdays are the new Mondays
The moana sound track is acc 10/10
Nice teeth are a must ❌
Lol
Cba with rude people bye
A large dominoes pizza acc lasts me about 3 days
Going to sleep happy for the first time in 2018, makes a change 🙃
So much I wish I could’ve done differently
Aw am fuckin done
Work to live, don’t live to work
What’s the actual point in starting a conversation and then not replying
Not ok
If only life was like it is in the movies
Honestly fucking hate myself sometimes, just don’t help myself
A love how much people care about my life, nothing to do with you bro? Merry Christmas x
I’m ready now
Can’t work out if I’m annoyed or don’t care
Needing someone that isn’t there for you anymore is so shit
Ever want to just knock some sense into someone::) same :))
People are so weird, take a break x
I’ve never been so tempted to book a one way flight out of Scotland than I am right now

Why are people constantly asking me for directions in Edinburgh?? I’ve been here 2 weeks, I don’t know where anything is
Am a fucking paranoid mess rn
Hate this so much
Update: a went out and slept in for work, happy Sunday everyone 😊
Wish I understood what goes on inside a girls head btw, acc different species
A want to go out but I have to leave to drive to Edinburgh for work at 9am, do I
Trying not to let on that you’re annoyed at something when you’re fkn fuming inside is so hard
Am not in love with anyone btw, was just a thought, no need to ask who it is x
