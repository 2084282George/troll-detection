I was eating a cookie and there was a hair in it. After trying, and failing to get the hair out, I just kept on eating it.
@GetterOfficial That's when the magic happens! When you do it with passion! Can't wait for it!
Really hope im not allergic to avocado. But I've had a bad belly every time I've eaten it lately.
I swear man, The only thing I've gained from eating healthy is intense diarrhoea.

Valerian and a city of a thousand planets was so bad. As an animator is was visually pleasing, but the storyline and movie were terrible
7 days of work without a break and a double shift on one of the days 😪 Glad tô be home in my bed.
Overtime and no days off is really taking its toll on me

This is the best kings cup I've ever had. I do get it every time though. 😒🤔 https://t.co/fkzjq7mxxu
My life has gotten so much better since I've grown my hair
Eating a greggs before going to another city makes me happy. Feels like I'm on holiday even though I'm only going to Dundee

@ocdvids @BaeDates This would be satisfying if the person holding the knife didn't cut like a 2yr old
If you've never contemplated the idea that your life could be like the Truman show then you are lying.
Went exploring last night with the boys. Hit up 3 different spots and had such an awesome time!… https://t.co/ZUVfiYFysK
I'm too tired to get out of bed to brush my teeth before sleeping but I can still tweet?!?!
Looking through my old tagged insta pics and I accidentally liked my exes pic from 2 years ago

Legit thought I broke my ankle today. That was scary. I don't think it's broken, but I did something bad to it
