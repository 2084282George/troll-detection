On Rinse this evening with @orla_dsf and @breakwavedj ahead of the party next week in Liverpool https://t.co/wegNO9VSUV
@samvoltek personally i think his heart was in the right place but it's just not been thought through well at all
this levon album is really good... just a shame about his baffling and offensive promotion of it, the awful track names and that artwork.
Tbilisi tonight for @Whities_ at Mtkvarze https://t.co/FvZeqztAHC
this really should be getting more attention.
MS x Blue Nile!

Can't wait for @GiantGiantSwan tomorrow!!
https://t.co/5y5MInJQYX
honestly the next @Reckonwrong release is probably simultaneously the weirdest and yet most sincere record i've ever heard.
