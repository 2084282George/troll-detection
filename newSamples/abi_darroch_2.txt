A little girl at work today called me pretty and it honestly made my day ☺️
Friends being in Netflix is a great start to 2018
@CommonWhiteGirI @mshaaaw
Can't sleep 😢
@mshaaaw procrastination has hit a new low. He is now just lying down belting out Britney songs 🙄
@mshaaaw She's the best ☺️
We just ordered so much food that's the waitress asked if we work out because she was confused as to why we aren't obese
Just booked to see my wee English loon for her birthday ✈️💃🏻🙌🎉 @Lauraa_Goodman https://t.co/KQwqUlBaBi
Me and @mshaaaw lost our 81 day snapchat streak and I'm devastated 😭
One of those days where I have no makeup on, hair scraped back and I'm just eating a big bowl of pasta 😶
@andreaahouston same sis🤷🏼‍♀️
@mshaaaw 😕😬
The smell of freshly made popcorn is so good 😍👅
@andreaahouston @Lauraa_Goodman @MeganCurtis18 this word haunts me 😅 https://t.co/ZsFWjx9jlR
I think I just need to sleep for about 2 days and I'll be fine 😴
@geeooo_ what a ledge! My brother forgot to say happy birthday to me last year 🙃
I can't be dealing with people who hurt my friends 🙄👊
@hannahislost thanks! Jamie Oliver's USA stylie pancakes 😊So good!!
@emilyykelseyy omg 😂😂 how did you manage that?
I'm the type of person who can be so full and feeling like I'm gonna be sick and then ten minutes later I'm sitting eating chocolate cake
@andreaahouston I got up at half 5 this morning 🙃🙃 we are living the high life
Truly inspired 💭✨
@hollymcmullan Happy 18th birthday wee one! 💕 throwback to when we were fetuses👶🏼 @geeooo_ https://t.co/qCeyQnYFiY
@andreaahouston I look drunk 😂
@geeooo_ @hollymcmullan 😂😂 oh my Hahaa, it's weird that I remember this day so well! Holly you look sooo small 😂
How have I only seen @geeooo_ like twice since I've been home ☹️👎

Liquid is interesting anyway 😂
@nationalexpress I booked a coach with you and received no email confirmation or ticket so I rebooked and I have now been charged for both😠
Shallow Hal is such a good film👍
@andreaahouston @alicekimberley 😂 https://t.co/XrHyFRGta7
I finished stranger things in a day👽👀
I'm actually so jealous of how much fun my mum seems to have had in NY and Canada!
In love with my new camera I got as a graduation present 📷❤️
I can hear T in the Park from my house and I live twenty minutes away🙃

1hr wait on this plane to change a part in the engine 🙂🔫
I love it when they put a final call out for a flight and the plane hasn't even arrived yet
The fact that my mums bought a jacuzzi makes me want to go home even more!! 😭
@geeooo_ @PLLrelate The fact that Hannah's not in the picture 👀😬
Get me home now ✈️🏃🏻
I want to see wicked again 💚
Me to a tee https://t.co/kUQvtCsHpl
Dissertation finally done!! 🙌💃🏻 https://t.co/r3AuSsNlKw
The cleaning in my house is always taken too far! The floors are so clean I have almost slipped about 6 times today 😒
The Dunblane: Our Story documentary on BBC Two is heartbreaking.
The waitress asked if I wanted a children's menu today...eh sorry no...I'm 20😑
Happy Birthday @ionahoustonx hope you've had a lovely day! :)x
Proud Camden tonight 💃🏻💃🏻 https://t.co/JEBhEEwW6T
@TheFunnyVine @andreaahouston the best aikido roll you've ever seen 👌
This dissertation is stressing me out already and I've barely even started it😰
My dads advice for today:
"Everyone plays the game. Figure out how to win it."💭
That horrible car journey to the airport when you realise everything you've forgotten
Annoyed that I guessed the ending to fight club like 20 minutes into the movie😑 just ruins the whole thing...
Good night ending with homemade quesadilla's💃🏻 (didn't have any chips)
My brother just knows about everything..He knows more about my dissertation than me &amp; is now telling me what linguistic theorist he prefers🙃
