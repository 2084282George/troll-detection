I have literally just attempted to post a photo collage on Instagram 3 times after missing people out! Flip sake 🙄
I feel like I genuinely gain like 3 stone over Christmas 😭
And the second I touch the remote control his eyes open 😭
why I thought wearing white jeans would be a good idea today when I was babysitting a 2 year old&amp;went to the park with him!Such a bad idea😭
@MhairiLou_xo ohh really flip sake what we gonna do with you Mhairi 😄
@MhairiLou_xo 😄😄😄
Having 3 coffees today was a bad idea as I'm wide awake and I need to get up in 5 hours 😩
So good to catch up with Sarah today 😊😊
@JamesClarkson96 @Mr_Smithable I don't care
It's actually all Ryan's fault 😭😭
I have completely finished Christmas shopping💃🏼🙌🏻
When you come home thinking there food in your fridge only to find out you're parents haven't eaten it 😠😠
Sunday nights has to be one of my favourite nights😊
Thursday morning are a lot easier to get through with the @KLOVERadio 🙌🏻
Just had a 2 hour call with my best friend is just what a needed😌
Sometimes you just have to sacrifice 40 extra minutes in bed for a coffee with your dad so he knows that you care
Just deciding that I'm not planning to go back pure blonde ever again is exciting and the money I'm going to save
I seriously can't get my head around how much people are spending on Kylie's makeup range

When you had to set ready in 3 minutes this morning 😴
No better way to end the night than FaceTiming you best friend💞💞
Trying to explain to @laurenmcgilliv1 that 5 situation where security had to come into the crowd&amp;remove people isn't normal for 1 concert
@IonaLucy I mean I seriously don't know why I was shocked it is Perth at the end of the day🙄😄
Been up nearly 2 hours and I'm already so ready to go back to sleep😴
No better way to spend your lazy day than watch all 4 home alones
People are so frustrating sometimes
@laurenafterall it's not just you, loads of people do it which is sad/frustrating to watch
Why does it always snow in Glasgow(Erskine) and not in Perth ☹️️☹️️
This has to be the best iced coffee I've ever had (probably because it's full of cream) #LoveEverythingAboutAmerica… https://t.co/kW49LT5OPj
It's scary how the devil/the world can make you believe that your actions are so acceptable when they're so not
When your friend doesn't want to be in the photo🙄☹️😄 https://t.co/3zUq2fOqjM
It's crazy that I haven't seen saz in like 8 weeks 😓😓 so excited to see her on Thursday😊
My mother may be the best listener ever 💞💞
I have a serious problem with going to sleep at a normal time🙄
I just want to live there☀️🌊 https://t.co/CinLn4PNUD
@HannahClarkson8 what colours...??
When you just get off the phone to mhairi after talking to her for over 4 hours, like seriously where does the time go👀
@JamesClarkson96 just cause you're from the same family doesn't mean you're classy👀
I miss California and Merritt!!! https://t.co/ccxz5Gv97V
The thought of wearing heels on Saturday makes me wanna cry
It's so encouraging to see my mother faith even though she in so much pain everyday
@MhairiLou_xo
All I want right now is a massive bag of flaming hot crunchy Cheetos😍😋💔
I absolutely love that my best friend makes so much time for us FaceTiming even though she's at uni and has loads to do❤️
Talking to @MhairiLou_xo tonight about me, her and @sarahw012 hilarious stories at mission and honestly I've never laugh so much ever😂
But don't worry guys my dad just has a memory like a fish and left something in the grill
@sarahw012 @MhairiLou_xo 😢😢
I swear I have a problem with food 🙄🙄
Like seriously can I just freaking hurry up I'm so impatient!
Miss these two a crazy amount already😔 @MhairiLou_xo @sarahw012 https://t.co/vdmM0K5wci
Guys with tattoos😍😍😍
Sometimes I wish I could be more patient with people☹️
Just received my first ever snapchat for the mother herself👀😂 https://t.co/bLbkJuLw4x
And thankful for nice person in the world that don't want to steal my iPhone
Sarah's snapchats are hilarious😂
@sarahw012 sorry👀😂
I feel like I've been very spontaneous at this crazy time in the morning ✌🏻💪🏻
The K-Love app may be my favourite app I own🙌🏻☺️
You know when people used to say drinking loads of water helps your skin I've come to realise it's a total myth🙄😔
Not only am I going for a run tonight I think I just agree on going for a run in the morning with Mhairi!I'm not gonna lie I kinda enjoy it👀
She planned the perfect day for me and loved every minute🙂🙃🙂
I seriously have no luck🙄😭
So me and my father managed to do 28/55 out of the Oor wullie's bucket trail far to say my feet are dead
Sarah's organising something for my birthday and she's not letting me know anything and it's killing me!
But on the plus side she's moving to Edinburgh and that city is so beaut😍
It's kinda scary when you realise how much you love traveling and that you're okay with not staying in the same place forever
I don't know if it's normal for a couple of my toes to be numb after wearing heels?🤔😢
Such a fantastic and unforgettable weekend☺️👰🏼
I actually hate how people think it's okay to exclude people out of things.When it's totally not!!!
Sometimes it feels like she's been married wayy longer than just over a year
@Danielle_5400 always choose sleep!! Hope you have an amazing time!
Just chatting to my mother tonight and never realised how much I've missed her these past 4 weeks😥
I actually hate Scottish weather so freaking much😩😩
Sarah is literally gonna kill me when she sees how much I'm taking👀👀👀
I can't believe I just had to kill a spider on my bed cover!ahhhh😫😫
nothing better the taking to u bpals about life and know they ain't judging u, when u can already feel the judgement from other people!
I still can't believe I came home from America to an empty house as my parents have decided to spend 2 nights in Aberdeen
My downstairs neighbours probably want to kill me as I've literally done 4 loads of washing straight after each other😬
Miss this little face already 😥😥 https://t.co/8b7ujEFsdi
O my days my freaking London to Glasgow flight has been cancelled😭😭
Sorry for the crazy snaps but I leave my favourite little human tonight so please forgive me
@rhianna_ell it so sad!!
I'm so freaking jealous of all the people that are going to see Beyoncé😔
It's actually so annoying how bad my skin has got over here like I thought the sun was meant to help not make it worse😔
Happy 4th of July🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I'm so freaking excited to go to California on Wednesday even if it is just for 2 days😁
Me and @sarahw012 have just decided we are going on a cruise next summer💃🏼
She may be my favourite little human being ever💜💜💜 https://t.co/gT8wGHBVn0
I can't believe I've already been here a week👀👀
Finding dory was honestly amazing!!!
