Why am I always waiting for the gals when we have plans 🙄
I’m nailing this living alone thing
Tell Brodie I’ll meet him in 25 mins, here I am 25 mins later, go to message him n say I’m here, and he was only ac… https://t.co/QvYsEmmN81
Trying to batter through this uni work so I can go home to my flat and lock myself in my room and sleep
Left for uni at 7am and I’m sitting here with 3 lines written considering whether I really need a degree
The person in the flat above me has the toilet above my bedroom and it’s not pleasant
Can tell I’m stressed when I wake up at 4am thinking it’s time to get up
Spending valentines night at the cinema with the gals 💓
No way has it been nearly an hour I’ve been waiting for a prescription
My snapchat has updated ☹️
Absolutely buzzing to go out for dinner
Half my room is in boxes now, moving out just became real 😳😳
Can’t believe the customer care team at @Qantas have still not replied to my complaint after 24 working days, do not fly with them 😊😊😊😊
Everyone needs a HB in their life
Have too little petrol to make it home and forgot my purse so sitting tragically waiting for Katie to come with Brodie’s bank card 🙃
Driving to uni on hands free to Kayleigh who’s screaming at a lorry
Today is a good day
If I don’t get taken to Nando’s today shit gonna hit the fan
Didn’t think I’d be spending my Saturday afternoon chasing Bella around to get a juice lid off her
Life is good 💓
The group chat with the girls is just 💓
In bed eating a big pack of minstrels and binge watching friends
I’ve spent so long looking at this lit review that I literally can’t register it anymore
I want to kill Brodie
My lectures are so depressing man
Just seen a girl that looked the spitting image of Blake Lively lucky bitch
Some prick kicking about Sighthill with a set of boxing gloves on just sums the place up tbh
Still howling that Brodie got kicked by a kid in work
Livi roads are an actual death trap
Liam: can we take daddy back to the baby factory
Finished swimming absolutely starving, n my maw the queen that she is had chicken pasta waiting for me 💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼
Kayleigh’s getting annoyed at someone breathing loudly in the library, I said “maybe he has a cold” and she about kicked my head in😂
I actually couldn’t give less of a shit about my dissertation right now
