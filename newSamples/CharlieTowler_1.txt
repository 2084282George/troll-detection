Corbyn will still lose, but hopefully it leads to a younger, charismatic and more savvy lab leader, who rebrands social democracy.
@SimonRetromania is like John Peel in is his restlessness to dicover new acts with something real &amp; original to say
https://t.co/D0i0i2yM7J

This venue needs to stay open as it's the only real place which supports experimental music in Ldn @Cafeoto 
https://t.co/a4nClolGvA
@markernestus' Ngadda Rhythm Force were amazing at @Cafeoto last night. Catch them when you can.
The only way Labour can win, is if they finally discover that Theresa May is not a human being. No one that soulless can be real. Surely!
Read @timlawrenceinfo'  Hang on to your Dreams, a beautifully written account of the life of Arthur Russell and the downtown scene!
Does neo-liberalism make people happy? According to these countries, no!  "out of date" social democratic ideals do.

It's winter, Donald trump is president and we have one of the worst governments in history, so why is everyone listening to loungey house?

@iamhamlyn Check this album, one of Jamiroquai album biggest idols 
https://t.co/lm6FeZPSvo
May still obsessed with Britain's being a leading power, to scared to upset our 'liberal' big brother. That fucking colonial mentality
@jeremycorbyn has to go. His desire to go down as a 'principled' leftwing hero rather than a credible opposition leader is smug &amp; selfish.
Teresa May is the weakest, most spineless and horrid excuse for a human being. Stand up for your people. #Trump
Love this record https://t.co/YB7Bpy7ipB
Love this dude's work 
https://t.co/NdvC962i3x

@JozefBrodala I agree with equal pay in nearly every other field, but they do play less sets.
