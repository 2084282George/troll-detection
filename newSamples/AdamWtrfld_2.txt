Empty polling station vibes.
@redmanwinoshoes #sick film though right?? OST is terrific.

@FuseFilmFestMcr Any of these film fans also literary fans? I mean come on, Fuse Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
@FuseFilmFestMcr Can I get backstage or is that For a Fuse Dollars More?
@FuseFilmFestMcr Presumably all the Fuseual Suspects will be there?
@FuseFilmFestMcr @russellcrowe (we don't).
@MovieQuibble Thanks a lot for the first instalment, carpet sample looks ace. When's the full room getting fitted?

@OllieCharleton @redmanwinoshoes More than one makes me ill.
Here's hoping BBNG3 has a physical release @badbadnotgood
@DillonSteele Yesterday I saw a man in Krunchy Fried Chicken at 2.30AM wearing red crocs and some 'The Amazing Spiderman' pyjama bottoms.
Installing Cubase. Prepare your ears for amateur attempts.
@OllieCharleton I wait, crouched in the corner, silently weeping, phone in hand. He hasn't replied. He'll never reply.
@LucyMackereth @CoddLizzie @_ItsMaggi @sophmunday http://t.co/DUVCyQzz - sums it up rather nicely.
@OllieCharleton That was incredible. But still not as good as trolling Saruman.
@OllieCharleton She's interested.
@CoddLizzie Don't dub it the party room if you can't handle the mayhem.
@Ihaveamusic I get some of it but from what I've seen you can just do the other questions, mass-energy equivalence is so much easier.
@Ihaveamusic The pole was both inside and outside of the barn man, I don't know who I am anymore.
@DillonSteele Mmm lovely milky puns all running down my chin.
@DillonSteele First lesson of the year. Mr Sharpe. Little IT room. It was too intense for me man, I got out, I got out sharpish

The real tragedy is that I now have 500 pence tied up in an nonredeemable gift card.
Guilty downloaders everywhere.
@redmanwinoshoes @OllieCharleton Love that album. You'll never guess who Ollie heard his new favourite song from...
@Ihaveamusic Attempting revision and I've spent the last half an hour reading What If?s, curse you for making me aware of this brilliance.
@Ihaveamusic Hahaha, I've got rags and petrol if you'll bring some bottles?
@Ihaveamusic I'm the same mate, haven't even looked at astro and as for everyday life... I went to two lectures all semester...
@Ihaveamusic Oh very cool, get one for christmas? I haven't heard anything more about this drum kit yet...
@Ihaveamusic ...Wednesday.

Browsing tvtropes will suck a revision day away like a mildly interesting leech.
