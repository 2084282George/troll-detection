Considering the circumstances, I'm not sure many people would enter... http://t.co/LmEZCEn4dV
Have seen 3 people sleeping in the library today. It's not exam time people go home!
So hard to read up on things when all journal articles results are literally the opposite of each other. Why can't scientists just agree? :(
@BioLabMan maybe she knew I was on to her so killed off one of her personas and decided to settle down
Lying on couch, breakfast on floor. Roll off couch, knee in breakfast. So milky
Dundee with ma cool kidsssss @TanjaTiainen1 @CharleyMMorris http://t.co/rvryTd7XV1

Studying late is so difficult with the absence of caffeine...
@nismoTK he's probably waiting til

Looking at a diagram from "Wall and Melzack's Textbook of Pain". Sums up the current studying rather nicely
Get to library. Discover have forgotten pen. Cry.
@Primus_Scotia attempting ha! I feel I am a couch potato at heart though
Always cry when Dobby dies...
@KristiPowrie @GemmaAnderson4 Have an awesome time and know that I am sick with jealousy!! Xx
First day of studying, one hour in. Already wishing for 4th of May when summer begins!
Can't wait for tomorrow; uni will be finished, car will be insured and drinks will be had for my besty friend @TanjaTiainen1's birthday :D
Going in to uni on a day off is heartbreaking.
Guy in garage shouting at man over tannoy "put the nozzle in the hole in the side of the car" if you can't refuel a car why are you driving?
Get to the subway platform just as doors as closing, worsttttt
@BioLabMan first embryology one where I fell asleep...
Furniture shop has furniture on the pavement and birds have shat on it all. Now I'm no business woman but Im pretty sure that was a bad move
@Welshy1992 hahahaa well I never thought about that!
Literally 3 people in the whole computer cluster, why would you sit in the seat right next to me? Srsly.
Sometimes at uni I get inspired to do a heap of studying and get awesome grades. Then I get home and realise I like watching TV way too much
Poptart looking cuteee :) http://t.co/lHw0C3JeRS
@HayleyJardine @welshy1992 @_louisecarr @grantanderson20 #weloveyoulisa can we make that a thing?

Anyone who puts massive plastic eyelashes on their car headlights needs to seriously reconsider
Guy in front of me going upstairs swinging his arms waay too wildly resulted in an awkward backward boob grab and an equally awkward apology
Woman next to me on subway sneezing particles of snot on to my arm at regular intervals was akin to Chinese water torture... Bleuch
Chewing gum and cream cheese... That shit don't mix

Tesco on Christmas Eve... Severely lacking in carrots, goodwill and general sanity
Revision makes me want to cry but Christmas chocolate makes it all better :) @BioLabMan you beaut! http://t.co/bw2xahI7
Out tonight with @GemmaAnderson4 already seen 3 cars getting pushed and taxi is sliding about in the snow... Loft Thursdaysss #noregrets
Wearing shorts that reveal half your ass cheeks on a night out is dubious enough, wearing that shit to uni is just morally wrong
@BioLabMan don't become a ginger moustached man then and you'll be fine :)
@BioLabMan he is boring me though... You could say I'm in 'shock' at how bad this lecture is... Nahahaha

Bought mum her first ever j√§ger bomb last night, she was sure they were called "gaygo" bombs

Been in my room all day #stircrazy
Library on a Saturday... New all time low

Buy the lightest foundation shade, still turn orange. Should make a shade 'milkbottle' in order to match my un-doused-in-fake-tan complexion
