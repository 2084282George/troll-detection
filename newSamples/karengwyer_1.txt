On the train. Next to me an unspeakably humourless man is trying to calm his crying wife by mimicking a cartoon rabbit.
@GiantGiantSwan Ah nuts, that's a shame. Keep it real, mens.
@hmstulta Ha. I don't know why I put up with roaches fucking on my butter in the fridge when I lived there. Bigger shit to worry about, prob

Sitting on a plane. Watching a woman watch a video of herself hypnotising a sheep.
Tonight, after hopefully catching Pan Daijing, I'll be hot-footing it to play a nice late one on the 303 stage @Norbergfestival
