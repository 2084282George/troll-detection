@Ke_Ga Hi- You gave us a business trial account. Wondering how can I test it with more than one account? Can't find the feature. Thanks!
I find it really annoying when a popular media publication rips content from users without giving them credit.

@JimmyK777 Sounds magical.
@JimmyK777 No mention of snow until the weekend James. A "nap" sounds great on an afternoon.
It's my first Christmas in New York, with most of my family. Feeling homesick though and I've been up since 4am!  #joinin
Loving #joinin tweets. Thinking of those alone over the festive period. Twitter community is great. ‚ù§Ô∏è

TV is off. Candles, a book, Twitter, and a blanket is all I need tonight.
Cadbury's chocolate does not taste the same anymore. What happened to our beautiful chocie?
