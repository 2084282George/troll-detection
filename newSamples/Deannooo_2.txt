Why is Forrest off? He’s the only one who’s went forward
@ScottD_95 It’s absolutely impossible 😂😂 you’ll spend all night at it 😂
Ever tried moving your right foot clockwise while trying to write the number 6 with your right hand? Easier than getting a hold of him
Ntcham. Wow
@James_Halld You’ll still be handsome as ever though
@aliboag Aye but what about the Bristol cities
@Ross_J_Stewart It tastes like a cheap version of it
Dunno how a feel about the new Irn bru, feel I’ve been lied to
@Whats_That_Now Not today
So good to be playing again 🥁🎸🎤🎹
Not all heroes wear capes @Ross_J_Stewart
Rear wheel drive and snow is not at all an ideal mix
@Whats_That_Now All will be good tomorrow 🕺🏽
@nina_marshall_ Absolutely
How are hibs not 1-0 up? Hahahaha
@b14ir Come to mine for a spoon
The sheer audacity of the folk in Greggs to tell you that somethings cold is absolutely mind blowing, 73 ovens in o… https://t.co/OGQY8vDTWq
@Ross_J_Stewart  https://t.co/i8wh5dm2AS
69 games, hell of an achievement, but it’s been coming for weeks, a centre back is certainly needed though
@DylanDavidWood @Chasing_Leaks Hold on.. ‘Chasing Leeks’? Jack are you winding me up?
@DylanDavidWood Is the show coming up here??
@Ross_J_Stewart Genius
Armstrong and Sinclair are absolutely howling
The 11th!
Tierney, captained Celtic and now Scotland, played all across the back line between Scotland and Celtic, legend in the making
@aliboag Jesus Boag, the anger
What a goal
David Haye hoping to fight Joshua? When’s he going to realise he’s done?
Opposites is an unbelievable album
‘A think ma ears hanging off’ best thing to ever come from darren fletcher
@Ross_J_Stewart 🤘🏼
#CelticFC is my choice to win the FIFA Fan Award. Who do you think is #TheBest? https://t.co/y7m5L6JN2S
@pagegregor15 Donkey
Nae scrapey wife from the dentist but a fill in, yass. Canny wait to have my mouth drilled to fuck and to choke to death on my own saliva
Not personally, she's lovely but her jobs a fucking horrid act of mouth terrorism
@Jakeroajer 10/10 for effort
Joe Lewis is a decent keeper but sometimes you actually couldn't put a price tag on him, absolutely ridiculous at times
Eduoard is looking the part
@DylanDavidWood 😂😂😂😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
25 days till FIFA 18, much excitement
@erinmanzie By the time you get used to it, you'll be heading home, sooo annoying hahah. It's even worse at home 🙄😂
Went Go Karting today. A small reminder of how I shouldn't go kart. Absolute bomb scare, spinning out, the lot, whirlwind of chaos kart
Am sat next to so many moshers with soupy BO and ones wearing a blue superman top and 3/4 lengths, getting the full Black Death of fear
Done it. Pished all over my ankle, thanks Deidre
Hope they break their entire body from a fall from my horrid flip flops, I don't use the basic flip flop system, poolside only. Dirty rats
I hate flip flops. I bought those hellish looking adidas slider things for Tenerife. Went to Siam park. Someone stole them, had 2 buy new 1s
So I've been waiting on this fight since the day it was announced. Buzzing. Bought it to watch, fell asleep and missed the entire thing. 😎
@DylanDavidWood @painesplough @NotTooTame He must of been livid 😂 absolutely gutted I missed it
@painesplough @DylanDavidWood @NotTooTame @DylanDavidWood 😭😭😭
@JamTarts @aliboag
Hate it when you're trying to watch something on Netflix and there's too many already watching something. Fucking had to make my own. Shite
Scott Sinclair, fantastic footballer, probably on fantastic money, banging wife,
Who the fuck cuts his hair
Feel like a proud uncle watching our KT take that talk in the huddle ☘️
Kieran Tierney playing centre half today and wearing the captains armband, the boy is living every guys dream
Getting rid of Sviatchenko would be absolutely ridiculous
As much as I like Dembele, Wouldn't bother too much if he goes. Good goal scorer, not a great all rounder, still young and tonnes to learn
@CelticTV only getting audio
Between Kouassi, Benyu and Ntcham, there's some serious talent there
Is that ref having a fucking laugh?
I hope Mayweather knocks the shit out of Mcgregor
Any news of Ntcham signing??
@ShaunBrennan67_ sviatchenko can play a great role if he ups his game
Who have we signed?!
@Chasing_Leaks @DylanDavidWood @Fenderloyal aye, be as well if it's out
@FootyHumour @Bono1694 @IGIBBYI
@ScottBeattie8 that English wife??
That singing dentist is absolute cringe city
Touch of class by paddy Roberts with tierneys top on 👏🏻
A hope that stockley gets fucked the whole game
@Goudie15 @pagegregor15 @Fenderloyal
Sickens me that these government fuckers are 'deeply saddened' by these events, well fucking do something about it
@RobertGoodwin__ so needy xoxo https://t.co/I7tCvSSbcK
@Ross_J_Stewart @greghemphill96 meant to tag you in this earlier 😂
@sam_brooksy @aliboag  us next week
@pagegregor15 am sorry but it's too much 😂
Perfume shop workers are a nightmare, worse than looky looky men, just step in the shop and yer absolutely drowned in everything, canny see
@rhxnzz @Chasing_Leaks @aliboag lies, he scoffed it and wanted a second but we told him no, had to lock him in a cupboard
@Ross_J_Stewart @aliboag oh god aye 😂😂
