@too_much_love Similar thing with Do You Believe - Cher, in mine. A solo party mind. That fucking autotune!
The time where you're waiting for a track to render is deep. The second bit of the render is a tease.
All We Ever Look For, Kate Bush just came on shuffle &amp; the intro was so unexpected I had to abandon what I was doing.
@ivorylabyrinth Sounds like the perfect plan!

Big chunks of snow on the cycle home! Ate some!
Just heard some of my new track on a PA. Can't wait to play it out
@tuuunuuut I judge competency by the arrival of a good table before trying to set up equipment!

@frontandfollow @TZombini Always the greatest reviews
I miss the streets of France and the searing heat of the south.
@RanoRanoRano_ Record storage ahoy?! Everyone goes to Eyekeah for that shizzle. Yours are cracking! I'd buy one!
One reason I love Grace Jones tracks is the utter persistence
No rain but super humid. QOM
