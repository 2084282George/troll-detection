I just want to inspire this world, I feel like that's my job as an artist.

Why stress over something you can't change.
While you're saying you want to die, someone out there is fighting for their life. Don't be so ungrateful.

how could you be so heartless?
Take the things that scare you, and become worse than them.

You've really made me feel different things I've never felt before.. In so many different ways some I can't explain
I miss everything. 😿
