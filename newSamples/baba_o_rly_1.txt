@glorbis Did someone say bugs üêõüêûüêúüêùü¶ãüï∑
@glorbis also I would dispute your contention that you're not "creative"
@glorbis That's a ducking great idea (yes I know they're geese but when else is that autocorrect ever going to be even kind of appropriate)
@glorbis and now I have another Montreal label to follow, yay
@glorbis :( hope she is better soon!
@samorama Cripes, I'm five years older than Roy Orbz was.

@glorbis unmanageable levels of cuteness here, I can't handle this
First time I‚Äôve seen Golden Donna live and he goes way harder than I would have expected, or at least he is tonight
Cold night warm synths. Frickin hike from Avondale
@kirstiecat I don‚Äôt think either of your Temporary Beauty Problems (as Warhol called them) detract one bit from the charm of this photo.
@kirstiecat Wow such a good picture!
Happy new year y‚Äôall. Be careful getting home!
@merrickb I‚Äôm at the late one! Nice pic.
At @ConstellationCh for Sun Ra Arkestra. Staying in tomorrow.

When your upstairs neighbor's alarm does a better job of waking you than waking her (time change edition)
