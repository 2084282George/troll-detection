@EmmaTaylor1994  Happy Birthday Gorgeous 🎉🎈🥂!!
Im so proud &amp; overwhelmed by my family. Loosing someone is difficult but they are all pulling together &amp; staying so strong for one another💕
All I ever seem to do in the evenings now is sit in front of the laptop looking at dresses that I want.
My dad makes my lunch everyday &amp; comes in to say hello every night. My mum just walked past me on the stairs without acknowledging Im alive😂
I've just written an unbelievably grown up CV
Sausage Party is the worst film I've ever seen.
