FUXKING
Tonight has been so good like
Fuck that noise
Don't know how to fix myself
I'm so upset with my self
I don't deserve anyone
Can't do anything bloody right
I just always fuck up
Add my snapchat - dandydaisy
So embarrassed for your life
My friends that are fan girls know their own minds and make their own decisions because they're smart girls and I really respect that
They say as gospel. Just stop think and make your own mind up instead following false idols like sheep
HAVE AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT THEN PEOPLE WILL TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY FFS IT MAKES ME SO ANGRY
You literally have no real opinions on things you just do stuff because other people have ffs
So nice
That'll be about me then
Can I disappear forever ?
Just text eachother ffs
Constantly ignored like
And I hate being an arsehole but can't help it
Wanna relive last night many times cos it was that fucking good
And it was all like to the specials and happy mondays and shit
Last night was just so cool
Fallen in love tonight about 17 times
Want to be a drag queen
Fuck I'm so excited for tonight
Your such a stereotype and it's pathetic man
Far too excited for fashion show and mod ball tonighttttttt
Your a dick
My lips hurt so much
Just remembered how much we all fell in love with surf instructor luke ahah
Feel a bit like a dick
Cold
Stfu
For ffs you are an arsepiece
Not all friends are shit though, the oafs are all grand beings
@_l0veiseasy euan is my utter fave

Feel sad bcos alone and no one loves me
People are arseholes
@lauraelizab3th I give you hug soon
Freaking out like
Hate everyone
Fuck off you complete attention seeker
Don't tweet about me you dick
It's so unfair
They're all so beautiful
I want to be slim and I want to be pretty and I want to look nice
Fuckety fucking fuck
What if everyone just thinks I'm shit
I wear so much makeup everyday and it's because I'd be far to embarrassed to not
And I'm so super fed up of looking bad and ugh
And I'm just gonna look shit
So nervous for my drama exam
Today has been great
