@NotAnotherJamie You aren’t going to get all those players for £145 million, especially after spending £75 million.… https://t.co/zv6b7hWu6q
@NotAnotherJamie Where would they all play?
@NotAnotherJamie You’ve already got Mane and Salah, you don’t need both Fekir and Lemar.
@NeilJohnny perfect timing as Netflix as realised another season of Brooklyn 99
@NeilJohnny Knew that one wouldn’t get past you
@NeilJohnny It’s alright. Vodka doesn’t treat you well
@LindseyInnes @clarkwalk cheer up, your at Jurassic Park!!

Iv had some horrendous Halloween costumes in the past but this years last minute teen wolf is going to be something horrendously spectacular
Today's the day. https://t.co/2YxoI9cXJP
Give Moyes a chance, get the youth in. Soutar, Lindsay, May, Cummings, Burke, even give John Fleck a shout.
Ok I was wrong about @CitizenMi that album is a banger.
Since Iv giving up smoking my dog hasn't shown me the same affection as she used too. What should I do?
My dog spew on me today. This is a new stage of the hangover regrets.

@NeilJohnny Since when did @NeilJohnny turn into a gentleman??
@NeilJohnny It could have been better, the cgi made the clown look fake and if they'd left out the weird monster it… https://t.co/SrHXwg8el6
@NeilJohnny I'm regretting this decision now
Why have I agreed to go and see IT. I'm terrified of clowns!!
So according to @thismorning if I keep on drinking IPA I'm going to get a nice rack of man boobs.

@_cbxtr Creepy and terrifying little buggers
@StarryChaos @_cbxtr @brandnewrock Don't worry I'll remind you :)

@rohanNICOL  https://t.co/mWeCYR5Pii
Random trip to Glasgow at the weekend, turns out there's a @bigfeedgla event on. Buzzing to finally get alone to one.
My mind is blown. https://t.co/rNgNsrTxqS
The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story is an incredible to programme. Definitely worth a watch.

So this is what a two day hangover feels like!!
@ciaranjudge it's tactical pal, get it out of the way with. So I can drink the rest of my time off haha
Teaching your mother how to use emojis wasn't how I thought I'd spend my Monday night.
Iv reached a new low, Iv found something further than the friend zone. I'm now the straight gay best friend.
Can anyone recommend good taxidermy stockists?
@LindseyInnes did you know he's a big deal in oil??
@_cbxtr slowly but surely getting there.  @clarkwalk and @GilboMonroe would be proud
@_cbxtr but this dentist appointment will make me go from a 9.5 to an absolute 10. Sorry for missing your birthday

When you're that tired in the morning you misspell your name as 'Great' instead of Craig.
@mooseblooduk any possibility you'll be rereleasing the Moving Home Ep on vinyl?
I'm seeing @BiffyClyro tomorrow, saw @brandnewrock last year and now they are touring together. They've created the perfect sandwich.
@themashhouse has there been anymore @ModernBaseball tickets come available? Or can I just glass collect so I can see them?
The fact the my mother moans at me for constantly playing 'shit music' means Blush is an incredible album. Well done @mooseblooduk.
@ktbenson this isn't a good thing. How can you live up to the name of big booty benson!?
@mooseblooduk you've done it again with Blush, thanks for reminding me of a lifetime of fucked up relationships
@mooseblooduk please stop reminding me of a girl that I've fallen for
@themashhouse fuck I need to see @ModernBaseball. Is there any chance of spare tickets coming up?
When you find out @ModernBaseball show in Edinburgh is sold out!!! https://t.co/xOosZiZIOT

Pokemon chat has been band from my house as my mother had enough of it 16 years ago and doesn't want it all over again.
The wait is over @BiffyClyro #Ellipsis https://t.co/eHyz7lVLtp
Being Scottish is like being the youngest child in the family who gets bullied and is forced to do what the other siblings want to do.
Please say I'm in the middle of a nightmare and we aren't leaving the EU.
@NotAnotherJamie hahaha you've got it right there
So my hair is starting to go grey, unbelievably unfair as I can't even grow any facial hair yet.
