@HollyGShore the girl needs to get her facts straight. Shes joking about cruelty to animals &amp; coming out with 'facts' http://t.co/MqgkvnXX8s
@HollyGShore @barefoootchild I just don't like seeing people joke about animals suffering, it's not nice regardless
@HollyGShore @barefoootchild actually it's a lobster and there's no muscles in its legs so it's still alive, so so cruel
That 'running of the Bulls' story on snapchat looks so unfair and cruel on the Bulls, wish shitty traditions like that would stop
Like why can't people just respect that when 2 people are happy together, you leave them the fuck alone, that's just basic fucking knowledge
Hahahahahahaha shoutout to Leigh beckly for threatening to 'break up my relationship' if Thomas 'annoyed' her, goodluck ya psycho bitch 😇😂👏🏼
