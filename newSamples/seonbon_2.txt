@mohamedghilan it's only because the Rothschilds don't control social media do we get to truly see what's happening in Gaza! #FreePalestine
I stand with the flag of Palestine and wish it was as powerful, my heart breaks a little more every day, my anger increases #GazaUnderAttack
@ShamsuAhamd nothing!! Not a thing yet no one steps in and saids enough!! Feels like ignorance is winning either that or denial #whatisworse
@SdSd123z because we have still not learned from the past #GazaUnderAttack #historyteaches #blindedbythetruth
@michaelabood1 there's obviously a reason! Cos everyone has been another country's fecking lapdog #dowhatsright #standwithgaza
@maiwaby can you believe the headlines about 1 Israeli soldier? Just an excuse to keep killing innocents #ICC4Israel #GazaUnderAttack
@francomorip your English is very good #PrayForGaza #PrayForPeace
@francomorip I live in paisley, just outside Glasgow in Scotland half the world away from you
@francomorip you can't help but feel it's only because they gain nothing! No oil no gas, nothing but an angry ally, but it's all so so wrong
@Mohmd_AAlhodaif I'm sure their parents would beg to differ!! Shocking #SaveGazaschildren #itsmurder
@Rimjhim_Eng @BarackObama how about diverting the $3 billion to Gaza to rebuild what you stood back and let happen #SupportGaza #shameonyou
‚Äú@royboy1872: @DrBasselAbuward @seonbon I love ye both‚Äù I love Palestine #GazaUnderAttack
@MarkRuffalo Israel have lost only soldiers! How many picture of dead Israeli children have we saw in the last 16 days? #GazaUnderAttack
