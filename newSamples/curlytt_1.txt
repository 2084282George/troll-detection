Rocked up to the Barbican for a few hours work - didn't realise that I'd show up at graduation. 'sake.

I mean, it'd be a shame if we made it boring for the away fans, right? #hcafc
The Royle Family Christmas special. It is time.
"Men with ven"
@MattyBurr Such wise listening choices. At least I feel very in touch with substantially shallow emotions.
@robbiecully1 https://t.co/x1aJugccFf
A giant TA to @BRMCofficial for soundtracking this weekend.
More Hookworms forever. Negative Space is the one.
@doug_grant @TomRushh You have a point, I will give you that.
@TomRushh @doug_grant The coming together of two, often three planets, leading for the ultimate experience. To concâ€¦ https://t.co/csmEhxObO5
@doug_grant @TomRushh Who even buys 'Turkish'? Doesn't even deserve a slot on the list IMO, even if it is in the 'shite' tier.
All Points East should probably just take all my money right now.
Looking for two War On Drugs tickets for London
Here's hoping they play similar games in London. Banking on 'Queensway', surely? https://t.co/a0BZYUTwtw
@MattyBurr Never meant to ignore! Nothing happened. I was merely complaining like the sad sack I am.
Definitely the only person buying factor 30 suncream in the gob-hole of October.
@MattyBurr :((((
The personalised adverts on 4od are just too much. Having my laptop shout "Tom, over here" on a hangover isn't okay right now.
Perhaps there will come a time when having a deposit returned won't feel like you're competing in the Triwizard Tournament.
God bless pizza and God bless Homeslice. A pound an inch and twenty is plenty.
Feel very GCSE circa '09 all of a sudden asking if places sell memory sticks.
Definitely quite an apt day for the new National album to drop, right?
@Carenza_ Hi Carenza, I work for the Ilkeston tourist board. I'd like to know any thoughts/ideas you may have to reâ€¦ https://t.co/8IPsZhL3Un
@Partisanpr Can't like it enough, pal.
I don't think I can comprehend the idea of ever having to listen to 'You Can Call Me Al' again. The 4am earworm is a nightmare.
Not sure if there's any reason to listen to Villains for the 5th time in a row but hey. It's Friday etc etc.
@Carenza_ Get off my social media back.
@Carenza_ Sorry, who are you? Why are you tweeting me?
@TomRushh Dare you to write 'slippery slope' in shorthand, you nutter.
But Josh Homme really is the man though, ain't he?
Wednesday morning went x423 this morning when 'Walk Of Life' by Dire Straits came on. Never danced through White City with such groove.
New @pinkshinyband is making Monday.
Definitely didn't mean for a day trip to Tamworth today.
@Carenza_  https://t.co/FoQt9HmqjF
@Carenza_ this is interesting to know :)
To clarify to anybody who may have been uncertain earlier, today is definitely not a t-shirt day in London.
@doug_grant after purchasing both cans at the same time, points go with lemon.
@VulgariansUK first round on me this weekend.
Blood orange San Pellegrino vs lemon. Debate.
@doug_grant "R4diohead saved ma life"
Definitely think there are better places to orchestrate a phone call than hanging out the toilet window, friend.
@chilternrailway please can I have more free quick wi-fi so I can finish this really important episode of Master of None? Thanks x
Caught in Berlin airport - the castle of Burger King, queuing chaos and an abysmal lack of plug sockets.
Awful news. https://t.co/Tmbu8n0pdt
@robyn_sian @bssmusic That's awright!
The look of confusion in Boots as I purchase Night Nurse to compliment my new jar of coffee...
@VulgariansUK Just saw her in Spoons. R'kid lives on, unlike her potato husband TC x
@LondonerHenry Happy to go for these if you can guarantee somebody can swap the two for Friday?
Having Wayne Coyne ride by me on a unicorn has changed my life.
@MattyBurr LCD!!
All of the Glasto-related out of offices raining on me...
@ConorMummery Dangerous bootcut/loafer combo.
The thing with Ikea products, is that they never quite go together like they should.
@NeilWillo93 Will you calm down, son - this is the internet, not your Call Of Duty Xbox Live chatroom.
Electronic passport readers never work - they there solely to say "na pal, you've aged awfully - get over to the back of the queue, Shrek."
So this is Primavera envy...
@TomRushh My wallet chain is useful too, stops thugs like you from taking it anyway.
@TomRushh Leave it out, yeah. I'm not a mosher!!!!!!!!
Just learnt that instead of filming my christening, my Grandad filmed the wrong one and didn't realise until they read the name as 'Harry'
@stockurs Calm it, you lanyard. As you weren't TC x
... and then at others, Hostel. Jesus.
Thoughts with those in Manchester. A horrible and numbing thing to wake up to.
@dugggy @VulgariansUK Hull 4, Brighton 0
@TomRushh 'Touch base' - what you are, a BJW grad 2016?
@TomRushh ALWAYS room for fun. Partic Saturday.
