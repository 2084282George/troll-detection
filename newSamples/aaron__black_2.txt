So hard to put into words how I feel about Robin Williams' death, it's incredibly tragic. http://t.co/ftnUnZSShQ
I don't care if it seems typical I absolutely love the beatles
Lying in bed listening to sgt peppers, feel super chilled
Its 3:21 and I've just finished tidying my room/trying to chase moths out of it
@JamieSkelton Yeah no worries man.
@JamieSkelton Good man!
@peterpan_lotlb Probably tomorrow man, Skelton and ally will be through and stu and josh and all that are coming to rooms
The last time I went to rooms was v v good but I think tomorrow will be way better
@_sweetexile A return from Glenrothes would be like £12. If you've got one of those third off cards it'll be about £9
@JamieSkelton @_sweetexile From Edinburgh I think it's about £16 for the return but you might be cheaper going through megabus
@JamieSkelton If there's one person I'm gutted about missing it's her. She's definitely on my must see list.
I'm beyond gutted that channel 4 had to choose to show Titanic at the same time as the World Cup final. Fuck you channel 4

@JamieSkelton I want to, funds are tight though so I might not manage it.
England let me down for £50, typical I'd lose money when I'm already like the poorest creature in Scotland
@JamieSkelton @whoiseuan I've never actually been to Hive haha! Anywhere that serves alcohol is fine by me.
@JamieSkelton Yeah man!
@JamieSkelton That would just be grim for everyone involved haha, especially so for me. My parents are bad people.

Today has consisted of eating in nice cafés, going to art galleries and buying new clothes and records. Best kinda day
'A few beers' with @JamieSkelton became being pissed on a train loudly singing purple rain with a middle aged couple. Great night
