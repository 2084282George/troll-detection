Omg do I really need a Ted-talkin’ nerd bro to tell me that in the US we throw away too much plastic? F no.
@djchloeharris Love all of his music...
“Ambient Grunge” another favorite track title
Watching both versions of Winwood’s “Valerie” followed by Eric Prydz “Call On Me” = YouTube power move

Shit. It’s coat check season. You know where to find me tonight....💨⛄️
My take on the song is it’s the voice of a sexy glam nerd telling you to not be depressed and just “move in stereo”… https://t.co/YM9vPMHjYb
