Feliformia 6. "Rest."
Feliformia 4. "I was all day circling the empty space I knew you'd leave. Did the family wish it was me?"
Feliformia 2. "Because nobody needs you like I do, for fighting this sick rotten ache, and I've draped the streets in all you've ever said."

Who Goes There? 2. "Did they brand your nape, beneath the royal cape."
How better to spend the evening than tweeting the lyrics of our new EP? We'll start at the end and work backwards. To hell with chronology.
