@meljanpar Hmm, same same same :)
@3particles so good! Such a ceaseless flux of solid sounds, almost like falling under a spell :)
@joshuadecter When that lucid dream that never ends stops feeling so surreal &amp; literal, I imagine. Would be nice:)
@anikainvada yeah, I'm tuned in to that vast &amp; ultimately doomed place called hyper reality, I hear you &amp; I'm glad you're there too. Cheers
@anikainvada hmmm, Montreal one day?
