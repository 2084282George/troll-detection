@simple_season If you like Italian, then Bar Napoli is a great place on the north part of Hanover Street.… https://t.co/VIKXV4R8Fj
#FirstDates Norman! 😭
I listened to 25,508 Minutes of music https://t.co/eamgTyIsC7
Controversial but I genuinely think Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas” is the worst Christmas song of them all.. 😖
Three days into two weeks post-op recovery and I'm already driving myself and family mad.  Climbing up the walls with boredom..
Present me needs to stop leaving so much shit for future me to deal with. Now present me cant go to bed right away cos past me fucked me off
@laurenafterall 'Accidentally'... 🤔 haha
Always get very close to falling asleep w/out setting my alarm, panic about it, set one, and am then very awake... 🤦🏼‍♂️
@rchlhgh @WeeRachey RIP us ⚰️
Come on lads! #WinForVern #backingblue #RBS6Nations
Snow in Edinburgh! ❄️☃️
The moment we all collectively went 'aww' #GBBOFinal #candice https://t.co/TN7cgvByUM
@WeeRachey dogs beat people so once you have one you'll be winning! 🐺🐺
Five days and I can get back to doing the things I want to do most
@rchlhgh also if in an hours time you're skint as hell i'm sorry but accept no responsibility... 😎
@WeeRachey probs best they don't explain if they can' will only lead to embarrassment...
Cooking when i'm starving always means i run the risk of deciding my food is done before it actually is, and giving myself food poisoning...
Proud to support International School Meals Day, and promote fresh, local, healthy food in schools. #ISMD2016 https://t.co/kByiDMyaxO
@WeeRachey happily!
"Do not go gentle into that good night"
@WhatTheFFacts do you have a source for that?
Cheese is my vice.
Prow isn't the same without @WeeRachey grumpily, begrudgingly serving me drinks... 😛🎅🏽
@lostinhannah well jealous 😞😞
@WeeRachey swerved a crazy myself last night hence why I'm saying 😛
@WeeRachey sometimes you're better not pulling in prow though...
MP speaking sense for a change. McDonnell is 100% right that war/bombing Syria is above party politics.  Should be a free vote for all MPs
This bus driver is clearly keen to get home. His aggressiveness is efficient and I like it.
@19S73 hope you're not struggling too much! I managed to get out alive in August, haven't looked back since.
@19S73 much better than ghost stories! For me tho nothing will beat viva la vida/Prospekts March. Death and all his friends is smashing.
@19S73 'adventure of a lifetime' thoughts?
@hannahislost @WeeRachey but not as suave as me #SmoothLikeGalaxyChocolate 🍫😋
@hannahislost @WeeRachey it's not the same now he doesn't walk around in speedos 😞. #IMissCasinoRoyale
@WeeRachey whaat!? Really? I disagree...
Can you imagine if our Secretary of State for defence had been to war, or the health secretary actually knew about health! Go @Canada!! 🇨🇦
Also achieved - not getting sunburnt at the beach! (Not hard, it is November. But still, it's nearly a first) #ScottishProblems
It looks so much friendlier this way! https://t.co/A1B17v3oy8
But attending the first showing of a Bond film in a tux was pretty cool though 🎩😎
16:00-18:00 is not the time for a two-hour seminar on theories in history :( #ShitEndToTheWeek #WhyAmINotInThePubYet 😢💭🍻
@PlainOldJamie answer: some point next month mate.
@WeeRachey deep down inside you know you love it!
@leilawallace #Napier
@PlainOldJamie that joke was almost as bad as your jokes. I apologise profusely.

I've got hiccups and they won't stop. MAKE THEM STOP!!!!
Just ate potentially the tastiest carrot of my life. And i went for a run earlier, and completed a large amount of paperwork! #ProductiveDay
If that's going to be the end of things I'll be gutted. Definitely not how it was meant to be.
Kinnoull Street's overriding stench of alcoholic vomit and weed. Stay classy Perth #LoftThursdays #EvenHiveIsBetterThanThis
It's more than five years since charmin became cushelle and bounty became plenty 😦
@laurenafterall noo! You're wrong! (For once 😛) choc raisins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; choc peanuts!
Controversial maybe but I reckon wallabies are better than kangaroos.
I forgot Sunday services were a thing on public transport :(.
Typical Scotland - raining to welcome me back from a three and a half week absence! ☔️
For this next act Ryan will - for the second time - attempt to catch the bus to Perth. Hopefully this time he will be successful...
My mother, brother, grandmother hate you too Kanye.
@19S73 @danniifalc @AdamCam25 it's a gd shirt! Stephen it's been a laugh! My sporadic employment will be far less entertaining without you!
It's sad how quickly I become bored of being home
That hashtag though! https://t.co/nmLEHyxqeV
Normal people drunk text or drunk call, I drunk tweet. I'm not sure which is worse really...
HMRC need to improve their hold music...

@PlainOldJamie it's not the first time! Though it is a rarity. Miss you too clown bro
@PlainOldJamie there was no benefit to the two major parties though so it wasn't well advertised, ppl didn't understand its importance :(
Drunk me thanks sober me for leaving a glass of squash and cookies out for when i came home.  They were very helpful! #DrunkMeFTW
Stories 1&amp;3 extremely important. Story 2 isnt. Ppl nd 2 wake up 2 what really matters &amp; care for what really matters! http://t.co/PwWrldYHx0
Ate too much for lunch and now have a powerful urge to take a post lunch nap... Revision ruins lives.
@danniifalc some point last summer I think. You mean the loft photo?

Why u would book yourself into the quiet coach on a train when youre travelling with 2 kids under 5 is beyond me. Family coach for a reason!
@taylorswift13 Join a friend at the RMAS commissioning ball, once judged by FHM to be the best party in the UK!! #getswiftytosandhurst
@danniifalc don't start till 4!? So lazy! I've been up since 0545 😛 #BastardNeedsToSleep
