Masturbation: the primary sexual activity of mankind. In the nineteenth century it was a disease; in the twentieth, it's a cure.
Familiarity breeds contempt - and children.
Sex is not the answer. Sex is the question. "Yes" is the answer.
An erection is like the Theory of Relativity - the more you think about it, the harder it gets.
I think same sex couples should be able to get married. Barack Obama
When a man goes on a date he wonders if he is going to get lucky. A woman already knows.
Nymphomaniac: a woman as obsessed with sex as an average man.
Literature is mostly about having sex and not much about having children; life is the other way around.
For women the best aphrodisiacs are words. The G-spot is in the ears. He who looks for it below there is wasting his time.
An intellectual is a person who's found one thing that's more interesting than sex. Aldous Huxley
Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good. Woody Allen
