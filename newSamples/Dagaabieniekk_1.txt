Bang bang came on and I just can't stop laughing😂😂😂
I missed the other bus cause it was early and now this one is late #typical

@ZoeHutton123 I get my work rota in soon so we can arrange something 😏
The only person I ever snapchat is Natalie
Bullying a bully doesn't make it better, it just extends the cycle. It's stupid and you're acting against your cause.
😴😴😴
I'd love to speak fluent Swahili
Unbelievable what stress actually can do to you. I've never had such migraines in my life 😩😩
Forgot how good Orange is the new Black is 🙌

From that moment you'll be out of place and underdressed
Game of Thrones was pretty damn incredible
Accidentally put paprika instead of cinnamon into my porridge
The NHS physiotherapy is rather crap
When u get 5 A's at higher and your entire family still thinks you're a failure
Konrad looks like a Mexican wrestler 😂😂

Listening to George's history work yesterday was hilarious 😂😂

U know u're tired when u can't use proper punctuation
Happy fat Thursday 🍩🍩🍩
The Lord took her away from me. She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good so I can see my baby when I leave this world
@ZoeHutton123 omg 😂😂😭😂😂😭
I seriously am so lazy with texting
Hate how from seeing George everyday I went to seeing him once a week 😟
Also I want to be sick but I feel like it would be painful seeing as the gap between my tonsils is about 0.2 cm wide
In case I die tonight I'd like to say that I love everyone (almost)
Fuck off.
Gonna kill someone
Do u ever just have a really shit day?😒
I hate that woman
My lighthouse, my lighthouse. I will trust the promise, you will carry my safe to shore
George told me I'm not allowed a pug so now my life is pointless 💔
@MikeDuce I'm from Poland and I confirm this is 100% true
First allergic reaction in years and it's on my lips so I look like a clown
So sometimes I'll be blunt cause it's better than sounding angry 🙈

Cause when the shit hit the fan all we ever had ended up burning in the fire
Because that song's called Leeches it reminds me of ms Watson and that fucked up story she read us 🙅🙅
I keep on having weird dreams
Quite nice how George gets off the train that I'm taking to Glasgow ☺️
Is it even possible to have nice knees?
I hate everyone
2 hours of my life wasted
@MhairiLou_xo @GodsTinyAnimals 😭
Pearl Jam are my babies
@MhairiLou_xo remember that time we were singing it on the train??🙈🙈🙈
I hate how my boyfriend lives in a different city cause it means it's really difficult to see him 😔
I'm not looking forward to the 500 bruises though 😕
I'm a cold train, fast lane. Caught up in the dirt rain. No pain, no gain. Walking like a zombie
@ZoeHutton123 I love you too Zoe 😘😘😘
The two past days were perfect ❤️
Your love never fails. It never gives up. It never runs out on me.💕💕💕
I miss George 😔
😷😷😷😷
