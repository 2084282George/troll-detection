@_mysticmegs Which one is me
Thank you for the votes. As predicted, I am the bigger wine mom. Tough luck, @HillaryClinton https://t.co/DqPsfCdGOM
I gotta tell ya, I’m mad as heck
@drninaansary Or, you could listen to my box-fresh LP, Pure Comedy. Available on platforms such as Apple Music, et cetera.
This is a key theme on my latest album, Pure Comedy. Out now on Spotify and Apple Music. https://t.co/87ar0mJrHY
@fiImreview The ingenuity of the youth. Clever, but no match for my smarts. Of which are unparalleled.
Idris steals the scene here. An excellent piece of craft, which is sure to inspire many more of my opuses.  https://t.co/R9gDnbyYwF
TWIN PEAKS out now on Blu-Ray
I Love You, Honeybear out now https://t.co/pFYHXSJyrV
@ghostpoet An interesting piece, but surely not the best of the year, by any means.
Who’s a bigger wine mom
#PureComedy
Haha, I can absolutely agree with this.  https://t.co/irXGwbFqfg
Okay, Serbia it is. https://t.co/1ocyNiBvTX
@Crashleo I'm not even sure debating with you is worth my time. But, by all means, look at the critical acclaim my latest piece received.
@Msldemarco Your music is meaningless. Listen to some Fleet Foxes, please.
@theneedledrop You're a joke.
@theneedledrop But thank you, I suppose. I am a 'cool' guy, depending on what the media has told you that word means.
@theneedledrop My music is the only kind that matters, you ignorant fool. I Love You, Honeybear transcends the medium itself. You're a joke.
@hehehiddles He would have nightmares not listening to my album - I Love You, Honeybear.
Where should I tour next?
@morvynholmes @jasonsherrit99 Did you, Morv? You've not listened to music until you've taken in this album.
What's your favourite of my albums?
@AndyyMcdowell So is my latest album - I Love You, Honeybear - but you don't see my bragging about it.
@JustJensenDean If you've not listened to my new album, you're a joke.
@SeanCummings3 Have you listened to my new album? Because that will really make time float by.
@astonhrmony Me? Of course.
@somewhereinjack @awgaskartn mine is I Love You, Honeybear.
@ChrisMcCabe How do you think my fans feel, Chris?
@macdemarcosband What did you boys think of my latest album, I Love You, Honeybear?
@_alexmaclean That's when I'm playing at The Roundhouse. A stroke of luck, to be sure.
@peeznuts New Musical Express bestowed it a 9.0/10.0. So your argument is fundamentally flawed.
@arjan____ You wish, Arjan.
@datewidthenite There is always a next time. Always.
@moonageddream You'll enjoy the show, Grace. See you there.
@bieberfifty @trilogysbieber Justin Bieber is a joke. Listen to I Love You, Honeybear. Then you'll know what music is.
@lucystewarttt Listen to my new album, Lucy Stewart.
