“@UberFacts: On average, people spend 80 percent of their time gossiping.” ...At least try and make it sound a little bit true
In the library and someone, somewhere, is tapping their foot reaaaally loudly. And rhythmically. It makes water torture look pleasant
It's an automatic flush, seriously all you have to do is wave your hand over a sensor. Apparently even that is too difficult for some people

Dominos driver came to door in new uniform complete with kneepads. Srsly what is a dominos driver going to be doing that requires kneepads?
Being in uni to do work before lectures begin is so depressing. The Boyd Orr building is slowly eating my soul
Microarray studies notes look so much less depressing now that @BioLabMan has scribbled all over them

@SnapbackHero92 my mum and dad came to wake me up at 11 by jumping on my bed, how the tables have turned
Walking through Glasgow at Xmas time is like being a little salmon swimming up a stream of angry shoppers and brightly coloured tracksuits
The word 'crimbo' should be banned

People look ridiculous when they're trying to stifle a yawn
@BioLabMan not as poultry
