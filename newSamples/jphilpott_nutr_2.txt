@tomnoon89 first one is - https://t.co/flVZ0XsipD second one is - https://t.co/4BDACl7Nco
Fish oil supplementation sensitizes the muscle to feeding and promotes MPS. Classic study in older adults https://t.co/flVZ0XsipD

4 wk high protein concentration during calorie deficit + HIT training increases lean mass and decreases fat mass https://t.co/KntqOCBbhA
@ScienceOfMuscle training doesn't effect me too much. It's more general fatigue like wanting to go for naps that are hard.
@ScienceOfMuscle I'm only joking mate. Keep up the hard work. I would forget the BCAAs and go straight to the whey though!
@ScienceOfMuscle well you can say goodbye to all those gainz!!! Where is the lion in you?!
@sftgym consume 1 leaf a day and never get cancer???? Your having a laugh right? @FitnessExpose

@ScienceOfMuscle can't gain while you sleep mate. Personally I only sleep for 2 hours a night
@thomascox24 @FitnessExpose flushes out toxins? No mate, that would be your liver
@ScienceOfMuscle @sftgym Sleep is important for not only performance but general health. Please refer to - https://t.co/3vAuCrof2k

@ISICGlobal I ordered it from the United Kingdom. Thanks
@AcademiaObscura @MikeLNewell Yes mate. A great achievement to add to the CV!

@ScienceOfMuscle can you send me a detailed plan? Haha
@MikeLNewell great to catch up with you and congrats again on yesterday. Hope you have a good journey home!
@ScienceOfMuscle hopefully it wouldn't send you to sleep!!
@JessCamilleri @ScienceOfMuscle it can be if you have an underlying heart problem. As SOM said, best to get checked out first!
@ScienceOfMuscle exactly, backing up advice with sound research and science. That's the aim of my research. Providing science!
@ScienceOfMuscle of course, wouldn't expect you to. I just really fear for some of the publics health with these 'gurus'!
This is absolutely crazy. Adding calories to water, fantastic idea! Some people must have too much money. #gullible https://t.co/RRamShPRKk
