Leaving work is a sure fire way to encourage rain. #meteorological #FACT
Great Easter service now it's movie time.
Did you know that you can make your Twitter account private? Problem solved. @VeraMat1998
Had a great time playing #SXSW. Now I'm in Nawlins hunting for a cool jazz bar. Suggestions?
Off to find some trouble on 6th Street today. #SXSW

Woke up with a cat on my feet. Standard.
Thanks Vic! Glad you like our site/Record Label. We're making some big changes soon too. @ThisIsVictoriaM

There is NO way the giant meat grinder won't save the day in this dodgy horror film I'm watching.
Remember when you'd record shows from the tv & catch old ads or news headlines then you'd watch the ads a billion times? No? Just me then.
Looking for some London interns for our record label. If interested email your CV: label.uk@mymajorcompany.com
Any promoters around Austin? Looking for a show for @taichiswayze
Houston we have a problem.
Looking for some gigs in Austin! Any help would be awesome!
Yes, if the song takes a turn toward the corny side I'll donate the song to Latvia for Eurovision 2012. @uniquenameplz
Tickets booked for SXSW! Now, any promoters out there? @taichiswayze are looking for another show.
You make it sound like I'm in trouble! Like when your girlfriend (or ex-girlfriends) say "We need to talk... " @FakeEmpireBand
18 new event invites? Settle down Facebook! I'm not that popular.
Two coffees before lunch. Why Dan, why??! You barely touch the stuff. This come-down is gonna hurt. I might go for a run in the rain!!

Time to tame my Telecaster's  troubled intonation. Bad Tele, bad.
On the hunt for cheap flights from London to Austin. Open to suggestions! #sxsw
Surveys show that 67% of 'Internet Explorer' users survived the blitz.
If you mess up just run really fast anti-clockwise. If the Superman films are factual the Earth will spin backwards & time will be reversed.
Anyone know any booking agents from Austin? My very handsome band @taichiswayze are playing SXSW & looking for some extra shows.
Have a great Christmas all. Enjoy turkey in moderation.
What to watch! Sweeney Todd or Rocky IV?
Off for drinks with the Irish outlaws. I'll have a Gin in hand before my butt even hits the couch, you watch.
Yep! We are all about finding music benefactors for our artists. Check our site & have a look/listen! @TweetingLi
Beef Wellington... My new favourite.
Ivyrise on tour with Mcfly soon! There may well be ballroom dancing & bush tucker trials involved. Probably in @ivyrisedan s dressing room.

A nice little read about niche Social Networks for Brands.  http://t.co/5x0Z0sgv via @mashable
Hot off the press. The @Draytones will be playing a FREE show at The O2 as part of the December Sessions on the 18th.
Finished shooting a music video. 5am start was a bit average.
Why is it so hard to cross London vertically?? Seriously, have you ever had to go straight South or North on the map?

We are indeed still looking for #Oxford bands ideally from #Oxford for a gig in #Oxford. You look like you're from London? @ChaplinMusic
Calling Oxford bands! Still got space for one or two more bands mid December. Hit me up.
Jaws it is!! ...of course. @oorworld @Alexarmo
If Bieber has a child how many months until Usher launches it's singing career?
Off with man cold today. I shall be fully charged for tomorrow though!
Camden & pale looking guy runs up to me. GUY: "You're a guitarist right??" ME: "Yes, what of it?" GUY: "Join our band!" ME: "No, not today."
The comp is now live on our website! Download the app for free & submit your tracks. Rhyme, Record, Release. It's very addictive. @CapitalR
I was in limbo. Twitter locked my account accidentally. What a scandal. @sarah_masterson
Good shout! @doublenegativeM
Looking for a cool Manchester bar for after our gig tonight. Any suggestions? Also Tweet if you want guest list for Night & Day Cafe!
Getting ready for Manchester tomorrow. Gonna be a good show!
Who lives in Manchester? I'm playing a show at Night & Day Cafe tomorrow. DM me if you'd like to be on the guestlist.
We're in next st 9:30! @shutup_april
They're cool dudes with a never ending array of brass instruments to play with. Well that's what it sounds like anyway! @betty_PIAS
Off to jam in St Margarets. Apparently we share a studio compound with The Herbaliser and one of East-17. Weird.
You have excellent taste! Let me know & I can stick you on the Swayze guest list. That goes for the rest of you Tweeople too @shutup_april
Special @TaiChiSwayze gig this Wednesday in Proud Galleries Camden. Check this event for details http://t.co/i07NDuqj Will be crackin.
We're looking for London interns. DM me if you're interested in Social Media and Record Company experience?
I've had a Jack Bauer day.
The new Iyyrise Album is out on iTunes http://t.co/Kmm832C4
Don't need no credit card to ride this train.
Any weekend involving a cheeseboard is a good weekend in my book.
Did you know there are people in post production with the job title 'Render Wrangler'??  @carlosnaude
Guten Morgen! @CharlieWozEre
Richmond Park Sunday. Gonna squeeze one last picnic out of 2011 even if it kills me!
Who wants to play bass for a hot new SW London band? DM me for details.
Definitely not going to Carnival today. Low key local coffee is the way forward.
It's a special gig w/ Kitsunés latest signing + 5 other bands including @taichiswayze. Did I mention there is a BBQ too? @CharVenn @McGuv
"I'm a dog, I'm a cat, I'm a wolf, I'm a bear. I'm a porcelain heart on three legged chair."     Catch @tenmenmusic Sunday @windmillbrixton
Rain Dogs by Tom Waits is my favourite album of his. Love Mule Variations is a close second. @SHOWNONAME
You London folks should all come to @windmillbrixton this Sunday. It's an all day BBQ. http://t.co/lsl2pF9
Either his site has crashed from huge traffic or Tom Waits doesn't know how to use the interweb. I doubt he cares either. What a legend.
It's actually self titled album, smart arse. I think your album should be called "Tea and Toast and General Pleasantry". @BenParkerMusic
Who's heard of the band #Ivyrise? They have an album out today. It's pretty darn epic.

#DansTopTip for BANDS: Promoters/Labels won't click 'Like' on a Facebook page to listen to tracks. Keep em unlocked or people will bounce!

Cool! I've stuck you on the guest list. Onstage a bit after 9:40! @sarah_masterson
Hot dog! I've cracked 10,000 followers!! I'm taking you all out to dinner.
