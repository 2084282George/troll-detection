@sarapascoe You and the other women on Franky Boyle's show are so great to watch, really funny and smart - inspiring!
Rare examples of a comedy chat show with more women than men on @BBCTwo right now
Ok so I already own ankle boots in two other colours but these are special NYE boots though so it's ok, yeah?
@NewLookHelp Hi, if you're sold out of something online is it worth me still checking in store?
@andy4wm @birminghammail Is it right there are plans to open the Moseley rail line to passengers?
@Sparky_FM Someone bought me a mug with "moody cow" on it... Maybe not offended but a reality check for me!
@kokahokey You'll be lucky if there's even a working toilet at my place ;)
Just sneezed in a big queue at the sorting office and no one said Bless You. Society is broken!

@Debenhams Hi, don't know if you've done something to your website but it doesn't work well on my phone any more, shockingly slow :(
I really want to hate the Heman and Skeletor / Dirty Dancing Money Supermarket ad but it makes me grin, can't help it.
It's that time of year again...  three spiders evicted in the last few days. Getting my glass-and-envelope technique down to perfection.

@jet2tweets Thanks for confirming!
My sadness at missing this year's @BoomtownFair somewhat soothed by the queue horror stories... won't be by pics of everyone having fun tho!
Listening to @BBCR1 in Ibiza, presenter keeps saying "the big show" is up at 7... @BBCRadio2 Steve Wright is in Ibiza?!

@giffgaff Hi! If I buy a phone from you, does it come with a warranty or anything if it breaks?
@kokahokey He decided not to go out in the end! Bah! He did at least watch Orange is the New Black with me though :)
@jeffstuka I know, what I do is so so unimportant and yet I get a pay rise every year, it seems so unfair.
@kokahokey Don't have much holiday left but maybe later this year or in the spring? Sounds like nice places in the UK you're visiting!
@kokahokey Oh wow! Well let me know if you're in the Midlands and want to hang out :)
@kokahokey I ended up staying up another hour messing about on my phone and now I'm tired as I've not had enough sleep! I never learn!
@semiruralspock You're looking well, guys! :)
My weekend lifestyle clock is so out of sync with my weekday clock, I'm actually going to bed 12 hours after I got up #sundaynightgloom
*one shop!
Why do I ever think I can go to more than one lunch in my lunchbreak and not be pushed for time and end up a sweaty mess walking back?
@NewLookHelp Hi! If I were to walk to Corporation St in Bham this lunch time would I find these in stock in size 4? https://t.co/BUzZxVDtWG

@kokahokey Ooh yes, with jam in the middle :) Doughnuts are my weakness, can resist most other things!
Some kind person has brought in Krispy Kremes. I'm dieting. Going to resist til this afternoon then be *that person* who only has half of 1.
@GIBBOOONS Good thing you included that photo, sounds like a euphemism!

@MoseleyParkPool Hello, people aren't supposed to be in the park at night, are they? Lots of noise very late last night and tonight.
Got a light coverup thing on to cope with this heat. Reminds me of Homer's fat dress... https://t.co/f1ioXriu7m
After much discomfort, Ive finally worn in the sandals that I leave at work for hot days &amp;I've now decided I don't like them (toe cleavage!)
My current phone keeps losing battery, thought I'd check out what else is out there - they're all massive! "Compact" screen is now five inch
@UrbanCyclesUK Ooh may come along to this! Will you be able to fit in seeing my bike during my lunch break?

I braved a day with no tights for only the 3rd time this year, now it's all cloudy. Wondering if I can handle taking my lunchbreak outdoors!
@GIBBOOONS I am sure when I did it I applied online and they confirmed acceptance after a day or so.

I couldn't seem to remove the Vote Labour thing from my profile pic so I just had to delete my profile pic... I am faceless for now!
The alternative is I stick the Vote Labour poster in the car window and drive it all the way up to Scotland! #GeneralElection

@misshevatreva That's encouraging, think Corbyn came out well there. Definitely not going to be a Tory landslide anyway!
Everything I see on FB/Twitter debates are positive about Labour but it was also this way in 2015. All TV vox pops show is ppl voting Tory.
