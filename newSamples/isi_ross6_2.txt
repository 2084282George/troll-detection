Wish I was one of those people who could have a giant bag of chocolate buttons and only eat a few and not inhale the whole bag in 10 seconds
Amazes me how distracted I can get whilst studying
Stressed about how unstressed I am for these exams
Love Ellen xx
@rynmorgn Feel honoured 😂
Got to stroke a dog at uni- day made 😊😊
WHY DO PEOPLE NOT PICK UP THEIR DOGS POO
Lying in bed watching Lizzie McGuire. Life is great
MIC gives me so much happiness
@leilawallace @aidanquinn_ @Turnitin Yes definitely agree! 😂
Already in need of another holiday
Zero motivation
Such an unproductive day
So jealous of everyone out in the sun ☀️
Waited to watch MIC until @leilawallace got home. True friendship right there
@leilawallace what did he think it was???
Have a love hate relationship with naps

I love cheese and I love biscuits but I will never understand why people have them after dinner
@leilawallace looking pretttyyyy xx
So done with exams and not even halfway through
So jealous of everyone with their Christmas trees up
Never thought exam stress would result in me sponsoring a puppy
