Feliformia 5. "And I'd trust the angles with your soul, and I'd watch them walk you away, but the rapture burned down their homes."
Feliformia 3. "Your eyes let me know for sure you won't be coming back. I prayed to your god but he had no plans for keeping you intact."
Feliformia 1. "All I could force was a brave smile, and promise that you'd be okay, when the end coaxed you from you bed."

Who Goes There? 5. "Spy them scrawl-sign your name: 'not guilty, but blamed'. Now go find a grave."
Who Goes There? 3. "Will this go the ground, maybe left unfound? Throw your red hands in style. Force the juries' smile."
Who Goes There? 1. "Will this go to the ground, maybe left unfound? Broke your soul down to bile. Marched you lifeless for miles."
