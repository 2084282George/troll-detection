@Brown_iZak @MRobinsonRhodes would be able to provide some good tips I imagine, if you ask nice enough! Hope you’re both well.
@JoeyFrances I like this idea v much and nostalgia in alt-rock/rock in general has been rife for ages. But I think… https://t.co/mLsyTjS98U

@JoeyFrances shave ya hair, go as Yannis Varoufakis. Double Dare ya (that means you have to)
@boulezian @unibirmingham Thanks Mark!
@TricksterPrince @unibirmingham @MBSBirmingham Thanks so much Matt - and thanks again for all your help!
Absolutely thrilled to be graduating from @unibirmingham with a Distinction in Modern British Studies! https://t.co/OhqNWUQGRD
Sad not to be in brum anymore so can't catch this. Would recommend for those lucky enough to still be there!

@JoeyFrances Yes please
"let us find happiness in being,
not looking." Searingly powerful  words, as ever, from @DaisyJacobs

and I'm back. What did I miss? Any racist history festivals rear their ugly head?
Writing woes mean drastic measures. I'm taking a break tweeters, see you on the other side in September.
@howard_carlton @SeanOliverMale The discerning British customers of HMV circa 1955 much preferred Jimmy Young. Tho… https://t.co/ghFndxIdvq
Bono's pained sincerity is a particularly hideous version.

@benmechen Thanks Ben! I saw this but presumed it was too late, then realised the writer's 75 so probably fits.
Hi #twitterstorians, me again. Anyone know what the professional title L.L.A might stand for after a female name in 1955?
This is the most beautifully strange thing I've seen in a long time. Makes you proud to be a spurs fan. https://t.co/Nj2WTxPvAe
@TricksterPrince YES! Thank you, I've been waiting for a book looking like this!
Has anyone at #MBS2017 misplaced a memory stick in Panel E? I've put it by the registration desk if you're looking for it.
Really inspiring first day of discussion at #mbs2017 - Already some interesting themes: Expertise, precarity, Love Island.
@DavidGeiringer @MBSBirmingham Absolutely 100% yes! Please can I write a paper on the rhetorical device of "putting it on" someone?
@DaisyJacobs Initial thought (trying to be nice to the close-minded) is that it might be viewed as a private letter someone has dropped?
To the certified legend playing a melodica on the tube as we shuttled into Kings Cross - Thank you for making my day
Slightly giddy from one of those rare archive days where everything starts to click... https://t.co/WSIS23HGFA

@TricksterPrince Letters to the Home Office?!
Upon reflection a 3 day festival of UK politics on the Isle of White would be utterly hideous.
@TricksterPrince @RuthLindley @History_Bham Cheers Matt!
@klhjones Absolutely! Maybe we should also get a telly perspective from @ChelseaAnnSaxby?
There is SO MUCH going on. Fragile masculinity, weird compulsory heterosociability, the maze of constructed reality.
Jesus fuck. D'ya think now people will realise just how dangerous a deal with the DUP is? https://t.co/op5332SFDT
LINCOLN! What?!
CANTERBURY. CANT. ER. BURY. WHAT IS GOING ON.
Every time I catch a glimpse of corbz I start welling up.
@ABearPursuesMe @karinsmyth You're very welcome. All feels a bit more important now...trying to stay calm
Sad for Angus Robertson. A great MP.
@GenuineBarticle Birmingham usually, but often in London! You still in New Cross?
Is Farage off the BBC yet? I'm finding Balls and Osborne's flirting intolerable.
GET IN @DrRosena
Oh fucking hell lads it's all a bit all over the shop. I can't deal with this right now.
@SeanOliverMale Bet they used bloody quills mate.
I'm watching cricket. It's incredibly soothing right now
@UKLabour @karinsmyth My fellow students/young people, get out there and change the world. We got this.

Just went on an adventure to the Moseley Post Office depot. Never go on an adventure to the Moseley Post Office depot.
@TricksterPrince Now all I want to write about is Ribena though...
This guy is the chief political correspondent for the Telegraph and he doesn't know what a democratic socialist is.. https://t.co/8SYQrtKNuG
