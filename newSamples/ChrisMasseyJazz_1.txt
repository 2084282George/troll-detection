@netflix is to comedy specials as @Oprah was to new cars.

Recently learned that @realDonaldTrump is a homunculus and the entire election is designed to turn the US into a giant transmutation circle.
It is my birthday tomorrow. I could lie and say I have big plans, but in reality.... https://t.co/yegvBvBC6R
@kubothemovie Was a beautiful work of art. I absolutely recommend going to see it. It is not often Hollywood gets something like this right.
Every week it seems folks say @realDonaldTrump has "crossed the line". Does that mean everything he said up until that point was acceptable?
We now live in a world where one of the most hurtful things you can wish on a person is that you hope they never evolve their Magikarp.
That moment when you realize you are more like #Tien rather than #Goku. Accept your limitations and be the best you personally can be.
To the mother on the train with the huge stroller they didn't fold during a NYC rush hour holiday commute: thank you for being the worst.
Fear not true believers.. The #powercosmic is alive and well. Nue music in 2016.
Seems like a lot of living jazz drummers have "nicknames". From now on, I am going by Chris "Skeetz" Massey aka Nutbutter Jones
Dec. 23rd can be a new #holiday tradition for you and your loved ones! Come on out to @blujazzakron at 8PM to see https://t.co/27dn3BnYVR

Why would a company named Frano-American make Italian food?
If they every make a @MittRomney biopic, They really should hire @GroovyBruce as the lead. #Uncanny.
I have put off recording my new #album long enough. Time for the #Avengers to Assemble! #NJP #PowerCosmic #Jazz #NueMusic #Swang #Wakandan

#Drummers; thoughts on the Dream Vintage line of cymbals? I have been a Bosphorus man for years but sometimes you gotta switch it up.
I think it is Ok that jazz doesn't connect well with most mainstream youth.  Everything doesn't have to be for everyone.
Behold the Power Cosmic in 2015. #jazz #avengersassemble #nickfury #powercosmic #swang https://t.co/5i7j2zxNIo

Thank you for your fantastic contributions to the world of Science-Fiction Mr. Nimoy.You helped an entire generation look up to the heavens.
So not to sound like a hater because I respect their musicianship, but what is the big to do about The Bad Plus? Am I missing something?
The world needs another #FrankZappa, both musically and philosophically.
I think I would rather see the new SpongeBob movie than 50 Shades; and the new SpongeBob movie looks terrible. #kinkforsadhousewives
Whosoever - Chris Massey &amp; The NJP: http://t.co/UBzpi5JCNA via @YouTube
#50ShadesOfGrey was a better movie when it was called #TheSecretary.
#Netflix I am not now nor will I ever be interested in seeing #TheInterview. You can stop trying to shove it down my throat now. #ThankYou
Anyone else tired of everything being made LEGO? #LEGO50ShadesofGrey
I took all my albums off of Spotify and Pandora recently..I know; I know...huge blow to the music industry.
Hope Solo is Han Solo's kid right? I don't remember reading about her in the Extended Universe. Not that it matters now any. #FUDISNEY
Leg day+intermittent fast= :(
I saw a kid with a high flat-top hair cut and I overheard someone else use the word "dope". #WTF year is this? #FF #YearoftheRetroAsshole
You should probably follow me on twitter. FB is getting pretty weak these days (i.e. the past few years). @ChrisMasseyJazz
Feels like at some point every jazz group ends up turning into a fusion jam band or hip-hop group...
A preview of things to come... #NJP #2015 #NueModel #Jazz http://t.co/Ue0e1C8nhj
2015 will be the year of the Power Cosmic...That is all you need to know for now. Ta ta 2014.
I like it much better when the upright bass player stands up. #DigIn #Grounded
I love that this time in the morning the only people outside are school kids and us idiots who work out way too early.  #wearingleggings
Call me crazy,  but I am startin to think Malaysia has no idea what it's doing in regards to air travel. No SE Asian jazz fests for me ever.
I think even Bob Cratchet had the day off after Christmas. Sigh....
Taking an extended hiatus from performing right now. Thanks to those listening so far. Meantime visit http://t.co/pv0IbNfKw2 #PowerCosmic

You can tell alot about a person from their favorite #Tekken character. If they say #EddyGordo, they prob take the easy way out in life
