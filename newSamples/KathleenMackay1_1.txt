"To get up or not to get up" now THAT is the question
@kennethmacleod too much effort and too little characters
Typical that you'd be faster walking to princes street and the bus stops would be out of use when bursting for a pee #whyme
@ConnorChalmers0 it's super cool #imwithyoupal
Your clearly forgotten about when you text both your parents separate things and neither replies. Only been gone three weeks guys.
On demand is rubbish can't even watch Waterloo road #whatislife
