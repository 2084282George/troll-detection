@StevenHarryMass Also lovely as ever to chat with @ChiaraDAnnaAct afterwards over drinks to congratulate her on her brilliant performance.
@StevenHarryMass I don't recall Becker giving this Tarentella a date but the video states it's from 1954. Vivid and Frantic.

My Dad never sang as a performer. He sang in the way a bird sings: as a beautiful and essential affirmation of their own existence. RIP
Still need to make more additions, but my website http://t.co/VW7McSMUcb is up and running at last.
When a singer closes their eyes itâ€™s in-order to engage with the omni-directionality of sound combined with their own resonating body.

@StevenHarryMass I'm curious as to whether this Vocal was pitched down or not. Because to my knowledge it never showed up on another CWBsong
@StevenHarryMass and musically it sounds like it was from a Joy Division rehearsal.

@al_dinja Okey Cokey, I'll call it "The Super Altruistic Benign Bot of Love", or maybe just "Bot Love"... actually I'll stay with the first.
Never felt compelled to look into translating Romica Puceano' words after 10 years. As it is direct from Voice to Ear. No Complication.

@serocell Yeah, Later on, we find ourselves approaching boundaries where everything becomes possible. Oops i ended that with a full stop
What's is man' obsession with imprisoning a butterfly? does it's transformations represent a threat to the dull stasis of their own life?

@PrisonPlanet @AbbyMartin  Journalists who strive for clarity should strengthen the link between their independant nodes at this point.
@serocell I Agree, words such as Civilized or Godly are used to reduce responsibility for otherwise heinous actions.
To control something or someone is the most inappropriate act of futility.
