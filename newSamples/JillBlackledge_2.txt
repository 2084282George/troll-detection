Test test test...123...Sundance, can you hear me? Should I send an owl? #creativedistro
My final takeaway from the #NBAFinals2015 is that the GSW championship shirts are conspicuously lacking gold glitter. Fail.
#ThankYouParksCrew for always putting friends and waffles before work. Raising a glass of Snakejuice to you!

#fallformal Friends are the glue that fix heartbreak. Friends and a bottle of whiskey.
Wally Pfister at #fallformal?! Just saw Moneyball today and can't wait for Dark Knight Rises!!
We've got our party clothes on...the only thing #fallformal is missing is an awkward middle school-esque dance.
#ThePlayboyClub had me shakin' a tailfeather and digging Chicago.
@simplythatdude Yeah!  My schedule is pretty much wide open...
Still in a New York state of mind.
@placito You're lucky you're engaged...you'd have to fight off ladies with posts like this.
Beyonce and Jay-Z are having a baby...that kid will have everything but a last name.

@lbv426 And this was just one measly little cocktail class.  Imagine what Vegas will be like!  :)  A good time was had by all!  Shake shake.
Two days after seeing #PiratesoftheCaribbean, all I can hear still is the soundtrack raging in my ears.
#Jobhunting is like sand on my face in the wind.  It's irritating, and things are palpable, but I can't quite grasp them.
#ShondaRhimes and #MarcCherry pilots have rocked my world.  I love ensemble casts and shady characters.
Best part of the #RoyalWedding was definitely the Aston Martin.  Drool.
@bretscott Do you have pointy teeth?  You've got the gray hair going on already.  ;)
@bretscott Maybe you're a mole.  Do you have shovel-like hands and beady eyes?
Ugh, #House.  My faith in TV characters' humanity is dashed.  I "lobed" them!  :'(
@JobiManson All around LA!  I still live downtown & I'm actually tweeting to you from the Anthropologie breakroom.  :)  I work at ABC too!
I want to take all the random junk from my film shoots and make a MacGuyver contest with it.
@mkosin If it was "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" Medieval, you'd be "not yet dead."
@simplythatdude I'm going for once every week.  It's a process to improve from once a month, you know.  It's a study in wit and brevity.
Bacon cheddar popcorn is pretty great.
Brains.

What?
wants to be a magician's assistant.
feels like she's living in Hotel California sometimes...minus the mirrors on the ceiling and pink champagne on ice.
@cinemawerks See, I thought that was in there somewhere but then I looked it up, and it wasn't in the trailer.  Always go with your gut.
is weighing the pros and cons of a calling service.  More money a month (a definite) vs. more work (a mere possibility).
