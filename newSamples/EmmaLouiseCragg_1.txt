@virginmedia Hi there, it was the home broadband kit, so the TV box and internet router
@virginmedia Hi, 2 different reps months apart told us we could throw away our kit when we cancelled our account...
You know you've hit full adulthood when the sight of an empty washing basket fills you with deep joy.
This happens daily on the approach to @TheForthBridges, driving there is appalling and there's nothing to stop it. https://t.co/IAeMpXNOwh
We can hear the Mossmorran flaring from our house, 10 minutes away from the factory. Feel sorry for any children who live next to it :(
@emma_oneill No one was hurt, just our poor little car. Trying to trace the Range Rover
@trafficscotland @TheForthBridges 4 miles of traffic Northbound to the Queensferry Crossing. https://t.co/R8iTw572lY
Traffic for @TheForthBridges is backed up to Fife Leisure Park. Also, Google maps thinks you can't get to the bridges from the North üëçüèª
@emma_oneill @TheForthBridges Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but for us the traffic started just about at the‚Ä¶ https://t.co/70uy83UXZk
We work 8 miles from @TheForthBridges. 1 hour 15 minutes after leaving work we are on the bridge.
Traffic to @NewForthBridge is backed up for 4 miles northbound, in case anyone is wondering üëçüèª
Also, Google Maps doesn't realise that there's traffic, so don't trust its ETAs if you're crossing the bridge.
...Good job SNP. Open the new bridge mid-week when people are commuting. How very clever you are.

Have legit just seen the double of @CrankGameplays in McDonalds in Perth, blue hair and all.
Why are pages 73, 80 &amp; 81 in my copy of 'The Bad Beginning' very slightly smaller than every other page?? https://t.co/F4JVVYPymC
I just bit my tongue trying to sneeze quietly on a train full of middle class people...
Some people need to be careful what they post on social media, they seem to forget who can see it. As an adult, I'd hope they'd realise.
I am currently the human embodiment of Newton's first law of motion.

Now, I know I was complaining about the heat, but this isn't quite the alternative I had in mind.

I'm so tired I've just made a cup of tea in completely the wrong order, thus rendering it virtually undrinkable.
Melody Movers finally home in Perth, selected for next round of @ChoiroftheYear! Thanks @appleton_tom for a fab day https://t.co/NMnGLKiBX0
Okay folks, it's time to form a protective circle around @SirPatStew and @IanMcKellen. They must be protected at all costs.
It's 1am, could those seagulls shriek any louder?
There's a seagull watching me through the living room window, it's making me quite uncomfortable...
There are very few foods which cannot be improved with the addition of cheese.
I'm starting to think of twitter like a middle child. I give it a lot less attention than facebook and tumblr...
Unbelievably excite to hear @ActuallyNPH will be playing Count Olaf. No other could do him justice. Seems he's already in character too...
I've been binge watching youtube for days, and now my subconscious only speaks in @Jack_Septic_Eye's voice. Time to stop? Nah!
Wearing microphone headsets makes my ears feel funny :(
Best part of panto is being able to bullshit when you forget lines, and it will still make sense.
Winter. Stahp.

I should be writing my politics essay, not binge watching @JimsTweetings videos. Not like I'm supposed to be doing a degree or anything...

Just want to say a huge thank you to the cast &amp; crew of @Thecommitments for letting me join you on stage last night. It was so amazing.

@bendelacreme is my favourite human being. #justsayin'
The excitement I'm feeling about the return of @CoSyntax is tangible. It's been a long time coming and it looks set to be epic! üòÑ
@LindsayMacPhers Aw, I really like this picture :3 I'll see you soon though, I'm sure! x
Where can I buy a pocket Ellen DeGeneres? It would be handy to have a mini ball of super sass everywhere you went.
I think people need to stop trying to relate fiction to their own circumstances. You'd be a lot happier if you focussed on reality.
I haven't done any sort of strenuous physical activity since I was 15. So why do I feel like I've run a marathon?
You'd think I'd have learned by now never to post an opinion on the internet...
I'm fairly certain you shouldn't get third degree burns from a macaroni pie...
Hades was the original sassy gay best friend.
Post of appreciation for the magnificent @eddieizzard. Not for any particular reason, I just feel more people should have him in their lives
ASDA have changed their Smart Price chicken noodles, and now they just taste like disappointment.
@EllieJane1975 Ermagerd!!! Haha x
Wasps. Why?
I just heard the funniest time travel joke tomorrow.
@ejafit Let me know if you're ever up north, we can have a mini chattergeek meet up (because there aren't many of us up here)
I have literally a million and one things to do, and I am resolutely not doing any of them because I am a terrible human being.
@ejafit That was beautiful
God said to John, "Come forth and receive eternal life". But John came fifth and won a toaster.
Can we just address the fact that Peter Capaldi wears skinny jeans as the Doctor? He's 56. This makes me happy.
This is my last night as Grantaire :( I'm going to miss that loveable drunk. And the waistcoat. I'll miss the waistcoat.
After an apocalypse movie marathon, my TV has packed up. I think someone might be trying to tell me something.
#thatwasunexpected While performing at Disneyland Paris we all turned round to discover that Darth Vader had joined in with our dancing.
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.
Mum: Are you packed for Disney?
Me: Hahahahahahaha no.
But I'm thinking that searching 'animals with human arms' was a big mistake.
Why aren't iPhones solar powered yet? Apple, you're missing a trick.
A room full of northerners is the best kind of room.
Dad has just told me he thinks people should be hanged for using their phones while driving... Now you know where I get it from.
Don't you love it when you try to wear all black but nothing you own is the same shade of black -.-
Wearing all black on the hottest day of the year so far? I have made a terrible mistake.
Nobody else is gonna put it right for me, nobody but me is gonna change my story, sometimes you have to be a little bit naughty!
@EllieJane1975 @officialbhoy I sold my soul years ago to the King of Hell himself, @Mark_Sheppard. I'm not sure he'd let me sell it again.
How do I convince my parents to get @officialbhoy tickets for my birthday? Hmmm...
You should go hang out with @BenWillingdorf on YouNow. Look, a magic button to take you there http://t.co/QoaH9kc0qU Now go, go, go!
If one more person asks me how I'm voting in the referendum, I might have to give them a friendly punch in the face.
Drunk midnight cooking is the best kind of cooking.
@onlyrasberry @BenWillingdorf @ejafit @TashaOrm @keytosarabe @slayitgurl It's close enough though! Haha :D
Not laughed that much for ages! Thank you @onlyrasberry!
@TashaOrm @ejafit Haha, thanks! It's a bit of an awkward way of socialising, would be better if everyone could talk at once, but good fun!
@TashaOrm @ejafit Sorry guys, lost the connection and couldn't get it back. Let me know when you next broadcast! x
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 What link are we using? Are you setting up a new chat?
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 We could snapchat him, find out if he's still around?
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 Works for me :)
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 The tinychat one works!
@oliverlupton1 @thurs_jay We can look into it. I'll have a look at tinychat too :)
@oliverlupton1 @thurs_jay How did you do it?
@thurs_jay @oliverlupton1 Me too. Don't know why we can't find each other. Check your emails, that's how I added you, there might be a link
@oliverlupton1 @thurs_jay I tried adding you with that email address, let me know if it worked
Missing @BenWillingdorf's broadcast because I'm at work :( Sad times.
After watching all of @BenWillingdorf's videos I've picked up his accent and can't stop talking like him...
We've just realised that the initials of our family (Steven, Rachel, Emma-Louise and Andrew) can be rearranged to spell 'ARSE'. Unfortunate.
Remember dial-up internet? Yeah, I didn't think that happened any more. Apparently it does. What is going on?
