If only my Tinder got as many matches as this tweet got likes https://t.co/SVq4TEzBxi
@mikethered77 That'll be the same person carrying on about football ;)
@andybriz Yes she's one of the few new additions that worked.
Things aren't looking too good for Snapchat. https://t.co/A3OhUEmAqC
@gemmaisshort Yes, I can't imagine many people actually are like that! Not intentionally anyway.
@frankieleach97 I feel you!
How do you eat yours? Probably not battered like this https://t.co/JrOkh5xgLV

I'm not convinced by the Instagram explore tab. It keeps serving me pictures of the Spice Girls and plates of beans on toast.
@Peculiar_Jenny Yeah these older people don't seem to realise we were barely out of nappies in the Blair era.

You know when retro Top of the Pops is the top trending topic that most of Twitter has also had a quiet night in.
