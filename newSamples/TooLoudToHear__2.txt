Amazing how arriving home to two wee cats waiting at the door for you can make you forget how shitty the world can be 😊

Hayfever is killing me 😷
Corbyn's going full savage and I fucking love it
Honestly didn't even know a party like the DUP existed until last night, horrifying.
Policies don't matter, the people just want to vote for whoever promises to keep the big bad immigrants out.
Absolutely crushing to hear that Conservative gains in Scotland have pushed the Tories ahead.
Gotta up the anti-Tory meme machine everyone, convince people to make a change! #votelabour
The thought of the election results on Friday morning is making me anxious.
Get me oot eh here
@kelsowilson_ Same gutting eh! 😔
Aaaand I'm stuck in the office till 5 👍🏻 https://t.co/LeMvaQfW0o

Forever hearing Roundabout by Yes in my head after starting JoJo
Contacted Fife Council three times about registering to vote and they've ignored me, no wonder voter turnouts are low! 😡
Don't be a twat, register to vote
Theresa May couldn't debate to save herself, she dances around questions and can't say much more than 'strong and stable' in every speech
I'm still not over that episode of Attack on Titan, probably one of my favourite anime moments ever
@kelsowilson_ Thanks bro, you mean Saturday!
WHY AM I WATCHING OUTLAST 2 GAMEPLAY BEFORE I GO TO BED
People are annoying
I love my cats
@yol9t  https://t.co/xPoPgcpnI1
So glad the woman taking up two spaces outside the flat is having such a nice conversation and ignoring the fact I want her to move forward!
@yol9t Not my fault!
Wish I would start making an effort to maintain friendships. Just let everyone drift away and then get annoyed when I get left out of things
@_BlackenedSky Best to just leave it be for a few years. See how this Brexit mess turns out and then maybe there'll be some context for it
@_BlackenedSky To be honest it's not about her. She's just at the head of it all which is annoying considering how unpopular she is..
@_BlackenedSky having one with any kind of meaningful result.. People are just too fired up on both sides of the debate.
Funny how people have the cheek to call a 2nd referendum 'divisive' when they are the ones who marginalise everyone with a different opinion
