It's two miles from where I live now but definitely Moseley in estate agent terms.

@KaizenCentre Hi! Are your classes PAYG or on membership? Can't find any prices on your website.

Been looking forward to 2017 Wipe but alas it's not going to be on! My 2017 feels like it's ending all wrong! https://t.co/K0iXCCyU4h
"I don't need 2017, I've got great boots" boots https://t.co/2GX916IgGt
Went into town to return something. Accidentally bought boots... :D https://t.co/I0C0B337XX
@kokahokey Yes! Les fixed it with cling film and a metal coat hanger. It works better than it did before.
@Midge_UK Couldn't you just take the opportunity to be late? ;)
Was hoping I could pretend it's the weather conditions that's made me late and not my tardiness... til I remembered… https://t.co/gKNR9BSRbJ
@imran__ab @nxwestmidlands 50 isn't mentioned. Looks like I'll be walking to work!

@leathersatchel Hey! Do you reckon you can fit a bottle of water in your 7" satchel? Struggling to visualise!

@HobbSquad Sorry for slow reply, I forget to check Twitter. City of Dragons. He's in a cage in the dark somewhere at the moment!
@robinhobb Hi! I thoroughly enjoyed Liveship Traders &amp; now on Rain Wild Chronicles. I have a question you guys might be able to help with...
Someone just rang our bell at this time... Can't be trick or treaters, surely all kids are getting ready for bed now??
@hogbham @CherylBoruszko That would be ace! One lucky person will get one of these in their Christmas stocking :)
Starting to get back into going to the cinema but am surprised #TheDeathOfStalin is not showing at either of the #Birmingham @ODEONCinemas

@kokahokey I agree two weeks is long enough to wait to contact them. Fingers crossed for you!
@Midge_UK Yes, I may have accidentally maimed one of them though, oops.
Stinkin' out the #50bus with ma nuggets
Internally screaming because colleague is reading out the *hilarious* exchange she had with someone on FB. Word for word.
@kokahokey I do normally have an egg, just thought I'd try something different!
When diet fads don't work: Skyr for breakfast. Very tasty, but by 10am I was chewing-my-arm-off hungry. Fat and carbs are needed sometimes.
In a rush, decided to eat soup for tea cos it's "quick". Won't bloody cool down for me to eat it!
@MoneySavingExp No such luck at Faro airport though, had to pay 2euro for a bottle for the flight home, ouch!
Hey @networkwm, waited for #50bus at Allison St (DS1) but 21:20 sailed past without stopping. I got an Uber rather than wait 20mins!!
@jet2tweets Hello! It is permitted to use bluetooth headphones on board your flights?
@anisha2910 @kokahokey You're welcome any time, Katy ;) Broad Street is dreadful!
Their two photos look scarily alike... https://t.co/KmI7GYX7IN
@giffgaff Thanks!
@dootis Mine used to have a little music player embedded with a few of my favourite songs. And Tom was always your friend.
Got the flat to myself tonight, going to watch a film my bf would hate - do I pick La La Land or Beauty and the Beast?
@kokahokey Maybe not, it's all your perspective I suppose. I've definitely worked harder in less well paid jobs!
Angry at "underpaid" used becaus ppl in same industry ar paid more. I work in office job; I'm overpaid. Nurses who save lives are underpaid!
@kokahokey Welcome back! :) Are you here long?
Dear America, I'm in the UK, can't watch GoT til tonight because I have to go to work like a grown up. No spoilers please, we're British!
@kokahokey Are you back in Istanbul?
@ricciardo @danielricciardo And THAT's why you're my favourite driver!
It wasn't my fault, boss - Superdrug was doing a 3 for 2 offer on everything and I couldn't decide what to choose!

@misshevatreva I'm lucky a lot of my route is on cycle paths!
One advantage of commuting by car would surely be that you could go for a nap at lunchtime. Bit difficult on a bike.
@kokahokey Something violent I guess - a bloody mary? I don't like them much though. Maybe a long island ice tea as it's pretty lethal!
Wait all morning to go out in the sun then once outside find it's a bit too warm, innit?
@birminghammail HI! Do you have a particular day you publish jobs adverts in the physical paper? I know you have them online too.
Thinking of buying myself a proper grown up watch (£100+) instead of cheap ones I've always had but so worried I'll lose/scratch/break it!
On this 4th July I am enjoying reading The Portrait of a Lady, in which there is much criticism of the British by Americans #IndependenceDay
@kokahokey I made it most of the day but then there was one left and I got FOMO. 200 calories on my app - could be worse!
Remember when all bloggers were like, "I'm going to try to take a photo each day!". Now... Instagram.. imagine them limiting it to just one!
@kokahokey Mine helpfully finished the icecream from the freezer last night - removed the temptation!
Has he got a zoo? I'm telling you, it's a world class menagerie!
Coping with the utter mundanity of Monday morning by mentally singing to myself Prince Ali from Aladdin.
Keep getting "festival fashion" emails that include playsuits. Ever tried maneuvering out of a playsuit in a portaloo?! Stupid.
@GIBBOOONS Damn, forgot that! He did push me over a couple of times, so like a really slow low key version of Tekken.

@kokahokey Congratulations :D
@HarryDukesJnr @MoseleyParkPool I know, I'm terrible, wanting sleep n all.
@kokahokey Yes although it does have a string around it to pull it in a bit
@greg_jenner Very good! I was expecting it to end with "wear sunscreen" though.
@semiruralspock Not for a long while, and then it will basically be a screenplay of the final seasons of the tv series.
@IAmBirmingham They can't let the march go ahead. No one wants EDL scum in our city.
@semiruralspock I think they would be a bit small inside.
I noisily messed up changing gear going up Hill St earlier and some idiots near the Megabus stop began cackling at me (cont.)...

@GIBBOOONS Keeping people in work I suppose! Or as it turns out, one person.
Generally my bf and I eat lots of veggie food. Tonight we're having steak, for once. Just found out it's #WorldMeatFreeDay. Oops!
Really pleased to come back from holiday to find all the #Birmingham Labour MPs re-elected, especially @jessphillips and my MP @RogerGodsiff
@NicolaAdamsOBE @RubyRose @GlamourMagUK Beautiful women :)
I'm on hols Wed morning, back Sat. Do I risk Labour poster in my window? Might look silly by Fri if #GeneralElection goes the wrong way!
Urgh, summer. Flats all have windows open, can smell bacon from flat downstairs. I have no bacon :(
@ashley_stockton I think there was a lot of critical questioning for May as well to be fair, but Corbyn is handling it much better.
@afneil Very good point, it's a typical response to other MPs at PMQs so why not a member of the public?
@kokahokey I read that as "smelly manure" at first, haha! Headphones &amp; eyemask help but not in that scenario.
@Anothergreen Hi, I added u just because I was amused u share the same name as my uncle. Now I see you're standing against May - good luck!!

Had a smug cyclist moment this morning - easily getting past all the road blocks round the cricket ground #birmingham #cycling
@kokahokey @martynhett Really sad to read some of his tweets. RIP.
So why has Labour in Wales been so rubbish (apparently)?! #BBCDebate
@sweet_asbattery Orange= Lib Dem. Red=Labour. Green=Green. Light Blue=Plaid Cymru. Blue=Tory scum. Purple=UKIP scum. Yellow= SNP.
@misshevatreva If I were a Tory I would be feeling embarrassed too!
