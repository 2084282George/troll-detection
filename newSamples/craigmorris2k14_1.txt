Bored af!😒
When your boss, goes all haywire on ya, and your just left standing saying what the fuck to yourself! 🤔
Why is it every Sunday, u can't think of anything to do! 🤔
When your in bed and the person next to you can snore for the whole world, And your left just staring at the ceiling wide awake!
I wish I could replace my heart with an extra liver and drink more and careless! 🍻
Catfish and the bottlemen- "Cocoon" what a tune!! 🎧
When your waiting for the hot tub to heat up 😊
