@ryan_deepclub Yeah lol people are dumb mostly
@ryan_deepclub I have given up asking DJs to lower their gains
Tfw @_rrao_ kills the peak time bossa set https://t.co/cUioysjT1Q
@mrsmithnyc DJs putting 1200s on their riders and then showing up with only usbs for me
Been drinking all day and I just want a dog now
@sevagranik https://t.co/cQ6pv1aWN2
@profgenius Depends what it is but Superior Elevation, Human Head, Academy &amp; Material World will be your best bets
Damn Ken Ishi is fucking banging the place
@SophiaMatilda lollllll
@ryan_deepclub @Snadbad @glorbis Music would be pretty boring if every track started with a kick lol
@glorbis @ryan_deepclub Yeah I find it harder to be accurate mixing based on kicks esp when the subs are right under/near the booth
@ryan_deepclub Dropping something on 2 or an upbeat isn’t really any different from dropping it on 1 though
@djauspex It’s very cool.
@lenorajayne Turrbotax classics?
@HE_VALENCIA All Mogami everything 💵💵💵
@nsig_ All of my vices are turning on me one by one

@yungmaans_ Lmao
@ryan_deepclub You can do it, and get passable results but if you really want purity it's better to avoid
@ryan_deepclub Yeah bc Dj mixers aren't really neutral sounding
@ryan_deepclub You can just rip from a 1200 &gt; DJ mixer &gt; zoom too, but only if you want to have messy files or do a lot of audio editing
@ryan_deepclub If you want good rips I guess step one is to start caring
@doktarspazz @glorbis I have the mini minimalist set as well, generally all pretty simple stuff
One of the best DJs you've probably never heard of - https://t.co/27EavbTBln
@SophiaMatilda You got the right idea
@Drownedxo Totally
I still vote, not really sure why. But clearly nobody is ever going to do anything
@djchloeharris Yes please
idk anything about their habits but I often find myself wishing Tangerine Dream had taken wayyyy more acid
@clubsensitive Always! She got a following!
@djchloeharris @pipecock Nah
@aerielist It was sweaty in there last night lol
@drift1974 @ambivalent Think it was quite clear we were joking about this stuff
@ambivalent But seriously (2 days before the gig) want to play for 3 hours longer than we discussed before? Think it will be best for you ;)
When my college calls me to ask for money it shows up in my phone as "scam likely" 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
