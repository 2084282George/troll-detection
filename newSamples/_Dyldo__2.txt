I am genuinely dangerously lazy. Like not trying to be cute and quirky. Sometimes I don't blow out candles next to my bed because I cba.
Telling me I'm not 22 is homophobic
D'you think I could just hack a year off my age and anyone would actually notice?
That bedroom always smelt that fags, foundation and vintage furs.
If I use any filter other that Sierra on an Instagram post, that's me showing the judges versatility.
Also they think that flags are wall art. Wtf.
You know. I really don't get the thing with gay guys being into straight dudes.

Not being a lame boring art snob but young sheldon is honestly contributing to my current depressive episode.

She arrives tonight and I'm excited but also weirdly nervous, and I keep having to remind myself it's nothing to do with me!!
I own one pair of pants, I only wear them when there's no boxers available. HOWEVER every time I put them on I feel inclined to nap.
I woke up in a silent, empty house today. So jarring. Felt like the opening to a zombie movie. Been carrying an axe‚Ä¶ https://t.co/IVR4Y5Fd7c

Welcome to the part of the night in which Dylan finished his second bottle of wine and tell everyone how he'd fix the DCEU.

January is hit me HARD mentally, feeling defeated, dejected and discarded. Thank god for my phat ass or I'd have nothing. ‚òπÔ∏è
My sister is watching Adventure Time and I just accidentally laughed at it does this mean I have to go to comic con now?
The only reason we have to put up with all this bullshit franchise movie crap is because aids killed all the real artists in the 80s.
Honestly I'm so pressed, I'm even pissed at Jude Law and it's super not his fault.
This movie can literally eat shit. Lmao https://t.co/YaAM7AW0y8

Also I think Kim K might be my favourite comedian.
I'm comfortable stating that Boots the chemist is my least favourite place on earth.
I wonder if anyone's coming out story starts with 'RuPauls Drag Race' appeared on the family Netflix watch list.
@cobracommandy No! I'll put it on the list!
I'm trying to read all those "important" books that I've never read in 2018. The ones that are wildly referenced in culture.
I want a mollie the horse tattoo. Absolute legend.
I need me a man to bring me ribbons and sugar lumps. Fuck communism man.
She had a literal sugar daddy.
1. What did you expect when you called a pig napoleon!?
@cobracommandy Because there is nothing more glam than being comfortable!
Animal Farm but instead of pigs and shit it's all Paris Hiltons pets?
@cobracommandy I'm doing a major google deep dive!

Fuck me UP queen. https://t.co/kg8ciyF4xK
Britney is such an underrepresented queen.
I'm watching a music channel for like the first time ever and it's so jarring seeing the music videos for some of these songs.
Like it's REBA and Colonel Sanders!? How is that not amazing. Honestly not to be reverse homophobic but straight people really upset me.
Like I'm sorry but what is not SO FUN about Reba as Colonel Sanders?
The video for Madonnas Hung Up is visual art.
Reba in drag as the new Colonel Sanders will be a genuine turning point in my life.
do you think I can put one of those Gwyneth Paltrow vagina eggs up my ass for a similar affect? Asking for a friend.
Ya'll say burns night I say All Stars 3 premier. I guess my gay identity trumps my nationalism. Oops.

If you have ever consumed green tea. Sorry sis, you're gay.
Everyone is gay for someone.
WOW. I'm surrounded by NEGATIVITY. My whole family have now requested I stop calling them all sis. Think again, sis.

@cobracommandy That's definitely a wig. I feel comfortable calling that a wig.
@cobracommandy This raising an interesting question about what technically qualifies as a wig
@cobracommandy On reflection this was perhaps a very strange way to structure my response tweet.

Sometimes I just make a stir fry using noodles and sauce, then eat that with a big bag of prawn crackers. No meat or veg in sight. ‚òπÔ∏è
You know I couldn't be less interested in VR gaming OTHER THAN a potential VR Just Dance.
None of you could ever imagine how hard I went on Just Dance when Promiscuous by Nelly Furtado came on. Iconic.
Dis me celebrating daddies birthday. https://t.co/8T6ZIKHUVy
That scene made me gay.
I want to win an oscar purely so i have the power to nominate the video for murder on the dance floor for best picture every year.
Murder on the dance floor is better than any other song ever recorded.
To remove excess tobacco from the head of the fag is to 'snatch the wig'

Beware of The Third Act Heterosexual Twist.. an investigative study by Dylan Holden.
We now have an iconic female rebel leader joiner their mission, honestly this film couldn't be gayer!
Now they've actually been kidnapped by a gang of men in short shorts.
Wait actually this film is so gay
I'm watching some weird straight person movie but Christoper Walken is the villain and he's SO CAMP and iconic I feel safe.
