I don't know what to do
I honestly can't put into words how upset I am.

Ah today was so fun
This is my favourite thing in the world http://t.co/pIHQneMjjt
Positivity is now going to rule my life, negativity does not need to be anywhere around me
Blythey's voice is like syrup
Fuck my throat hurts
Wwry rehearsal all day tomorrow with my team woo
Idk cos I would miss people
Don't even want to go back to St. John's after Easter or exam leave
Really enjoyed today was so good :)
I was upset then I realised that I'm a human being and I demand to be treated like one
Adlib today woo
I shouldn't be a person
Can't do anything right
Why
Awkward
Made me forget about everything that's shit
At least square gets me
@supernaturass I miss you and love you and want to see you
So unhappy with myself
I don't deserve anything
Such a fuck up
Ffs
Can't believe I kissed someone called square
Ignored yep cool
Throats so sore :(
Sorry for rants tonight but ugh that annoys me
People don't seem to know that celebrities will say anything to gain more media attention and you shouldn't treat everything -
You jump on every single bandwagon to make yourself seem cool when you just look like a dick
Fuck sakes
Great to know my friends are laughing at me when I'm so unhappy that's fucking great
I'm just so unhappy
Fuck I hate everyone
And it's my fault for being an arse
Literally like only people that text me are lads I've met, adlib fam and my cousins
Feel sad bcos none of my friends like me cos I'm an arse
Was totally fucking crazy
There was like boys my age full on mod dancing and it was fucking great
Fuck
Fuck this is so cool
Goals http://t.co/Q8VhLC2UUD
But who cares live your life and be shallow idc for you anymore
Fuck it's gonna be so good
Honestly wish people would just admit they don't like me instead of pretending to be my friends
Just admit that you don't like me instead of making it so blindingly obvious
Miss my cousins so much already :(
I really wish I could unfollow you oops
Oops
My cousins are my best friends
Ah shit
Ffs
:(
Surfing today was v fun
Friends are so shit but cousins ain't
Vomit
Ireland is fun
@choc0latemilk @davmrgn my lil baby :(
@supernaturass yeah
This night can't get any fucking worse
“@88foxes: I will never understand why English people say 'mom'” pet peeve omg
There's a reason no one likes you
Mo and Julia are so beautiful too it's so unfair
Or fionagh or Kat or Sarah or Justyna or all the girls
I want to look like Jess or coragh or Laura h or Laura w or Sam or Roisin or sian
I don't want to do this
Oh god it'll be so embarrassing
So nervous
I'm just so sad
And what if I'm shit and I fail I'll just want to die
I have to wear a dress and I just don't want to wear it in front of friends
You actually just disgust me man
Happy day
