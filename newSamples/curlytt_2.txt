the sound of Ryan Adams is saving my bacon this Valentine's https://t.co/5HyYRS4U2l
Father John Misty in Halifax and Britney in Scarborough. 2018 really is the year of Yorkshire.
New @HOOKWORMS is all sorts of wonderful and beautiful.
@NeilWillo93 @TheAnfieldWrap @LucasLeiva87 @NeilWillo93 hahahaa
The reality of ‚Äústand clear, the doors are closing‚Äù is actually a lot closer to ‚Äúf*ck that, I‚Äôm going to hurl mysel‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bsL8FMjfFN
@harveyy1 @doug_grant Fab.U.Lous.
If all #hcafc games ended after 80 minutes, the world would be a much saner place and I'd keep all my finger nails.
The cardinal sin of Cup-a-Soup.
Sorry December 29, Black Mirror is on so I won't be doing anything. https://t.co/0AF3cNFrkS
Spotify tells me I've listened to far too much Ryan Adams this year.
Never get cute with the Circle Line, it'll eat you alive
Span the new @HOOKWORMS number 100 times since first hearing it and still don't want to turn that rhythm off.
@TomRushh @doug_grant Valid point. It's a bit too dessert-y IMO. An everyday chocolate needs, substance and energy‚Ä¶ https://t.co/PW0BVzYMUY
@TomRushh @doug_grant Curly Wurly that high up?! 0121 DO ONE. A total mess of a chocolate bar - nobody needs that many crumbs.
@doug_grant @TomRushh Treason with the Yorkie though. That deserves way higher. Where is the fruit &amp; nut version too? Go-to heaven.
A touch scared by the sinister Halloween/Christmas lovechild that occupies the Westfield right now. Two events that should never marry.
@CharlesCaley https://t.co/x5y3e17Ajw
NG's 'Fort Knox' is a bit bloodeh cool.
YA https://t.co/Y4AK42MW8o
The jet lag is strong. Managed to put away a great three hour George Harrison: All Things Must Pass doc since 3:30am though. Monday, begin.
https://t.co/Xqh3EqbNQp Highlight of the week.
Fuck the O2 Arena.
Eating two McDonald's hash browns in Notting Hill is today's culture clash.
Found a bit of cheese and pickle sandwich in my pocket last night at what seemed to be a London Fashion Week event. I call it, 'Hull Chic'.
#topsoffforLoyle
@Carenza_ üôÄ
Just had a great time listening to Artful Dodger ft Craig David on the walk back from the tube.
Flogging a spare #Interpol ticket for tonight at Ally Pally - face value, ¬£30. @harveyy1 @interpolfans https://t.co/mX8lqa4ymv
New OCS is huuowge.
that boy Chris 'The Blade' Hardwick @porshyne https://t.co/WbdpksIkIv
@Carenza_ Was it from Deliveroo? https://t.co/YThuN2rOKF
@TomRushh Good to know that ¬£2k fee was worth it.
Definitely wish I was still 16 falling out of trees and diving onto tents at Leeds Festival - being a general, irritating whollup.
Glad I'm not the only person who believes in the three drain rule. Spotted in White City, another chap hurrying to sidestep manhole covers.
Forgot how great fudge is. Probably going to have teeth like a Grandma from Cow &amp; Chicken by Friday though. https://t.co/jffX3PHwon
@Carenza_ Quite funny and interesting, actually. 4/10.
but the new @TheDistrictsPa album though...
Slightly belated input into the whole 'new Horrors track' conversation but - g'awhh, it's bloody good ain't it?
@TomRushh A discreet scent of desperation and insecurity emitting from both age groups.
Mixing Lynx Africa and M&amp;S Woodspice spray surely gives me an average age of 24? 14 year-old acne going on 45 year-old nervous breakdown.
@Rivers47 Hi Mark, don't suppose you have an email you could send through please so I can send you over some music? Thanks a lot, Tom
@Carenza_ trust you to pick the red coloured can. Notts Forest through and through.
@TomRushh Leave it out alright, this is their work experience. That was Harvey Fenny not too long ago, how do you think he got work at PG?
Ryan Adams' belated response to The Strokes feels justified with the lasagna comment. Kudos, Ryan.
@thomasjsmith__ @NME Congrats man.
@TomRushh Oh yeah. Oh man. The words of a true sub-editor.
I love humans. https://t.co/jLwCqigZ3g
Must stop shouting 'you 'ull' in my head everytime something goes right.
Wondering how somebody is just opening an email now which I sent it over 6 months ago...
Almost getting hit by the red Westfield car that's driven by a Charlie Chaplin lookalike is a real low point of the day.
@dugggy Sar vis wun tym, ye?
Slipped up today and called an elderly lady 'our kid' when getting off the tube. It was that bad.
@LondonerHenry Hey Henry, which day do you have them for please? After Friday...
"Shit, I hope they have Radiohead on the TV in the pub tonight"
Never flipped a coin to decide a gig before but LCD vs QOTSA warranted it.
Richmond is FAR
The @qotsa teasers are too much. Can't hack it anymore.
Listening back to Good Shoes' 2006 classic, Think Before You Speak. Long live the landfill.
@_brokenwindows @alt_J Hey Kristelle - will DM you now x
@robbiecully1 @MattyBurr @CharlesCaley https://t.co/2Jl4J5CxZp
New Arcade Fire is mega. Very Paul Simon at his scattiest.
@TomRushh Townie.
The awful reality of Spanish radio is LMFAO - Party Rock, followed by Kesha.
Should probably chat about how bloody amazing the @pumarosamusic debut is.
If the tube is delayed, why must everyone stop and photograph the board as if they are always hard done by? It's only 2 minutes r'kid.
Alex G's new album is bringing back memories of Toy Story.
@harveyy1 - look at them chins son. https://t.co/wjF1dXr6pM
@dugggy Did we win?
@TomRushh Bring your 4B, cause I'm here to stay, son.
Battling through 400+ artists this afternoon to try and whittle down some sort of Great Escape wishlist. 2 days beforehand is a little late.
Have a habit of shining my Royal Gala as if I'm about to whip it down Headingley wicket at 96mph
@BRMCofficial announcing a London date has made Monday all okay. It will all be good from here onwards.
Eugh, losing to a poor man's Newcastle. Pickford is a quality keeper though.
"How long is a piece of string?" to be replaced with: "How many beers needed for the train?"
