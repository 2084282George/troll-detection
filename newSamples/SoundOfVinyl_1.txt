Michael Cera's album is just a genuinely peaceful bit of music.
Feel for all those who were gonna head to Jabberwocky this weekend, sounds like it was gonna be a good festival.
Well Zombie is a pretty decent little number, good to have you back Jamie T, ally pally in November might be a shout
That newest Jamie T track is just fucking brilliant.
First listen to new Morrissey record, I'm gonna love it I just know.
Might fire up the old review writers (my fingers) and post something about the new Morrissey record tomorrow.
@zachbraff how much do you love The Shins on a scale from 1 to they're the best band to soundtrack my amazing films?
Mac Demarco soundtracking and advert for Etsy. Edgy.
First listen to the new Jack White record Lazaretto.
@LHall69 true, his ego is definitely the worst thing about them.
The Orwells' debut album is insanely good, such raucous rock n roll.
This time last year I was at @IsleOfWightFest with @SloaneSinclair and @richm1992 looking forward to seeing the Stone Roses that night.
RIP to an absolute idol of a generation and industry, Rik Mayall, a British cultural icon.
The #UKIPDoArcticMonkeys is going to be my entertainment for the day.
Sounds like Kasabian were listening to a fair bit of Crystal Castles and Kraftwerk in the making of 48:13.
Everyone getting excited for Finsbury then?
Morrissey album World Peace Is None Of Your Business scheduled to be out July 11 (my birfday). Fair to say I'm fucking excited.

New Kasabian track has grown on e a bit, mainly because Serge is such a cool guy and is the best thing about the video.
@AKA_DanThompson I'll definitely give the album a proper chance as they're too good to write off
I don't pop molly I rock Tom Ford.
Wish I was headed to @CitySoundPro this weekend but I'm back at uni, enjoy it every one who goes!
