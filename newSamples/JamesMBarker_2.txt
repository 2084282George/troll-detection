@LeGrove Why do you always say lack of signings is the root of ever problem at Arsenal? You're analysis is becoming a parody.
Lead Ballon: underrated comedy.
Alan Carr chatty man, infinitely better when muted.
@cesc4official get an iPhone son Blackberrys are for wannabes!!!
That, then I go to my cupboard to find a Spurs 3 - 2 Arsenal coffee mug!!!!! FML
@DJTayo what's wrong with it? I may or may not work at a place that deals with broken iPhones on a daily basis.
@piersmorgan you are such a wally Mr Morgan. How have you got so far I life?
#YesLordSugar but where is Herr Baggs?
Directed Armstrong to Miller today. Brilliant.
@aliunwin I had a signed contract, paid all the monies due and still it fell through. They did give me free fizzy water though.
@johncrossmirror how bad a break? a metatarsal can be broken in a number of ways not all that long term?
Offside. No debate. This is when football is fucking gay.
Wenger and Pat on the BBM. #Arsenal
@johncrossmirror It's not a change of true meaning when it is 'Spurs Game' for 'Carling Cup'.I think you have missed the point spectacularly
@ajhmurray boring historical accuracy. How dare you challenge a national
myth!
@Arsenal_legrove as soon as possible.
@CallCollymore because QPR is in London, not Birmingham. Different levels of income elasticity.
Too much bloody Popuri for my liking.
@kanyewest You should move to London, make a break with the past.
@Arsenal_legrove I agree what a bloody clusterfuck.
@Arsenal_legrove I think we are in danger of playing into their hands if we get too worked up by this.
It is always a little worrying when the Germans march out in black.

@johncrossmirror Look what Souness said on training at altitude? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSS4RWxGRWA&feature=player_embedded
They only held the #worldcup to see Eboue.
@feverpitch they don't
Almunia for England.
@alexalbrecht Going to miss USA v England in the World Cup. Priorities.
@Swannyg66 it is only you no one else has made that point.
The guy next to me on the train has an ipad, iPhone and, what's that?.... Oh a blackberry too and yes he is hands free on his phone. Ledge.
@Twittlejohn You are like the fat one from the Bash Street Kids
@iaindale Sky played more of the Gordon Brow speech than the BBC.
@CamdenJo But now is the defining moment for the Liberal Democrats. Make the right choices and the party will take a huge step forward.
Today #imnotvotingconservative because I'm not a cunt, or my parents; I give them the benefit of the doubt you see.
@legrove I'd be interested, how much?
@SexAtOxbridge as a student of history I'd have to agree http://tinyurl.com/nhntcc we do have the best sex lives.
@watsoncomedian Nice one.
When someone wins an ITV competition they become a national treasure
@legrove The one in Cambridge is the biggest in the country - shit fact.
@RealArshavin I say you should play as soon as possible. No world cup for Andrey we need you to win this leauge! Also do you like your song?
@Manuel_Almunia No given that we will have the ball the whole time you will have plenty of time to tweet during the game! #wecanbeatbarca
@feverpitch Shit too slow.
@planetjedward 15mins up. Bye.
A stopped clock is right twice a day.
@DJTayo I only speak from experience: called Collymore over the Cesc Spitting after he got me well and truely wound up, I was the real mug.
@arseblog No harm in me also saying what a fucking tour de force of a blog that was. The more ire the better your prose. 8 more years!
@DannyTRS fuck off
I believe it was the great philosopher Ice Cube who proclaimed "It's on...like Donkey Kong". Words to live by.

I'm having a Houmous themed nightmare, with Tortilla Chips the main protagonists.
....It's time for board-games!
If only Rage Against The Machine had been on X Factor. Life would have been simpler.
Eugh groundhog day.
All I know is that I'm in London. The rest is a bloody mystery.
I'm a clown running across a minefield
@henrywinter the worst bit of 'journalism' I've seen. You argument is so full of holes it doesn't merit analysis.
@alandavies1 Are you serious? It doesn't eclipse all he did for Arsenal does it?
Oh let's discuss the weather! I hear it's wet.
