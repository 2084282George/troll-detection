@Sorayea Feel it in the end? Are you booked for any afters?
@Sorayea you got in?
@Lyleugleman in north stage, will prolly camp out here for the ride
@Lyleugleman just get a wristband before you do what I did lol. Turns out I knee the lady giving wristbands so I missed a calamity
@Sorayea best of luck with the queue :)
@Lyleugleman i'm loving the queue vibes rn
@Lyleugleman i'll probably stay on the North Stage for most of the day but I do fancy seeing Theo Parrish and Move D hbu?
Rate that 90 degree angle https://t.co/HneGrQL3T0
@pearsonsound Locked! That blend was groovy
@Lyleugleman https://t.co/s4MufJZxaF My personal fave
One for the bucket list. Big up @djstormdnb
@auroramitch Pickle Factory, Matthew's yard in Croydon or the Work Bar are my guesses. Best of luck :)
@codeinedrums Not sure if this is what you are looking for but I've been using the ACS non customised ones for club‚Ä¶ https://t.co/fWt3O7ZVHp
Even waiting for the bus in the rain won't dampen my spirits after that. Cheers @kodenine
@Lyleugleman True, be grateful and all that :)
