@pbarclaytimes I love Sagna but he hasn't won sweet FA yet. Football is consequencetialist not intentionalist.

@thegoonblog At least their grammar was correct.
@CallCollymore I didn't hear the same when Shawcross broke Ramsey's leg. All we heard was 'he is not that sort of player'.

@KellyCates I had a R.E teacher who showed us 15 mins of Groundhog Day every class for a year, on repeat. I think it was a lesson in irony.
Lolerpool are perpetrating a massive lolocaust.
@cesc4official What's it look like Captain?
@Twittlejohn No they shouldn't, too many common numpties as it is.
@cesc4official http://twitpic.com/2l58jx - I wonder if you were from Blackburn you'd have the DNA of Blackburn FC? No didn't think so!
@Arsenal_legrove I see your twitter on my feed and remember to check the blog. I would be quite so dismissive, despite lack of direct impact
@sidlowe I was taught the Spanish Civil War by Paul Preston, an absolute legend, although he was never quite so kind about my essays!
We'd still be in this World Cup if it hadn't been for that pesky Kwame Nkrumah. Come on you Gold Coast!!!

Eboooue Eboooue, he comes from Africa, he just merked Kaka #worldcup
Algeria is a shit France.
I like Torres, but is he gonna score doe?
Glad ITV didn't show me the goal. I personally only watch football for the Hyundi adverts.
@iaindale He is on the BBC. God you are a numpty. Good value, but a complete numpty.
@wengerball agreed
@caitlinmoran you and me both.
@FootballRamble No fuck them Cambridge got to the playoff final two years in a row and never managed it. This makes it all the more galling.
@iaindale I love watching you get all flustered on twitter. Not nice being beholden to events. British conservatisms last cry; a whimper.

@arsenalopinion You wont. The spuds will lose in the qualifying round. Can't wait.
God the marathon is sooo long.

@SexAtOxbridge You'll be in Light Blue then.
@feverpitch Guess that means Tottenham will get the chance to be knocked out in the qualifying round for the Champions League.
@legrove I got my hair cut by the guy who cut Fabio Capello's hair. Cooler.
@StanCollymore Why don't you never write your banal witterings down in any form?
@DJTayo Oh god Gough is such a fucking retard. Tear him a new one. It will cost you Â£10 in call charges tho.
Bridge left Terry hanging. That was a public burn on him.
@gunnerblog it is a photoshop job read the comments, nip this in the bud.

I actually laughed. Stoke 1 - Arsenal 0 long throw!
I wish Chelsea would remember that all their best players are away at the African Cup of Nations and that they should be dropping points.
Glee is shamefully good.
Just passed the Emirates. Don't fucking tell me 2 inches of snow is dangerous. Poor form Arsenal. Most fans get the tube or walk. Wanky
Bleugh.....

It's Christmas. The family is stuck in the house together
I love eating fish-pie! Yumma Yumma Yumma

I miss nights at onanon like a hole in the head.
I'm so shameful
I hate public-transport and it has nothing to do with the transportation.
@henrywinter and they'll hit deaf ears. The ref didn't see it. Gamesmanship is part of football like in every other sport.
