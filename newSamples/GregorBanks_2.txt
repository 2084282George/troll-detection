@JamesClarkson96 Couldn’t they have brought in grid boys?
@nommmmmi What have they done?
@neevcochrane Is he a chef though? He might just bring you free green tea otherwise
@JamesClarkson96 Worry about yourself
@sammy_robinson1 Yeah. United should have coasted that game. Martial, Lingard and Rashford all wasteful. Dunno what… https://t.co/zqsmMcUhzV

@ConorDow @M_Sutherland9 You’re rolling in the money, mate. Treat the girl.
@ConorDow @jamsey2004 It’s a shame Mr Dow doesn’t understand sarcasm
@jamsey2004 I remember the day we beat them 11-1 in pre season.

@kiwipendleton Sweet
@kiwipendleton @nommmmmi And your response was...?
@skysportsperth @LethamCommAFC I'll be signing with @LethamCommAFC . Promotion this year 👍🏻
@nommmmmi I feel like that creates division and always thought, in my mind, that the word in question shouldn't be used by anybody.
@mick_k86 @mattjohnross @realDonaldTrump Did you not know he's a Christian?
@WilliamHill BTTS, Ronaldo to Score, Casemiro to be carded #YourOdds
@WilliamHill Coming up as a bet on Kosovo instead? Still not seeing it.
@WilliamHill It's not there
@hasbean Email pinged back with an error.
@WilliamHill draw half time. Man Utd full time. Mkhitaryan to score. #YourOdds
@WilliamHill Paul Pogba to score any time and Man Utd to win both halves. #YourOdds
@laurenafterall Do they have enough songs?
@jamsey2004 Deadly
United may have a shot at the Top 4 if they can beat City, and Liverpool drop points.
@Quinny_280 sounds like Rod Stewart
@hayleyrclark I thought I'd bet on Definitly Red. Turns out it was One for Arthur 😂

Seeing Louis Walsh looking lost and confused at Edinburgh airport has brightened up my day.
@BeckyRitchiee you did that for a 10 minute meeting? Should have Skyped :) I fly tomorrow. Wish me luck!
@bequietamy that's probably the most difficult challenge ever given, and not because of how much you love it :)
"I wanted to see how it goes. Full pelt...at 70mph" @JamesClarkson96
@_naomimcgrath is there any cons? 😂
'Animal Style' by @BiffyClyro 👌👌👌
@KLM we managed to get rebooked eventually. Our new flight has now just been delayed by 40 minutes, after a 12 hour wait in the airport
@KLM myself and my friend are needing to rebook a flight after our flight from Amsterdam to Edinburgh was cancelled
@_naomimcgrath action men 😂 is that what the kids are calling them these days!?
