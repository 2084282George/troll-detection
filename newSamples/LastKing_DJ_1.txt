@HR_Clark please don't die.
This "bae" thing needs to stop. No seriously, stop it. Now. Like right now. Just. Just. Stop. Please.
@AntoniaLThomas didn't realize who I was talking to on Tuesday. Would've asked for an autograph if I'd known!
@joanne_poyner kids these days. Always got new slang terms for making whoopy.
Your "no makeup" selfie doesn't count if 1. You're still wearing makeup (we're not that stupid, we can tell) or 2. It's in black &amp; white.
Just found out Drake's real name is Aubrey. Uh...what?! ðŸ˜‚
@joanne_poyner don't know who "someone" is but you tell them to shut their dirty stinky mouth. You. Are. Awesome.
@Wendinabox look who's listening to Miguel now...
Too much awkwardness on this train. Like 10 people just moved.
@hanzomacdo I was born ready.
@hanzomacdo @HR_Clark you both should come to Glasgow!
@Kaitlin57 there were times when I went to sleep with clothes on and woke up naked but I don't think they count...

@ChrisLauu yeah man, when you back?
I remember the reason I don't use twitter a lot...it rhymes with "the people"
Don't send me a 2 second snapchat with 5 seconds of reading.
Just noticed that I read texts/tweets/messages etc in the voice of the person that wrote them.
I'm not saying I look good, but I'm not saying I don't either. http://t.co/opd6U0p1pM
Getting on the flight first for having kids lol niiiiiiiiiice
Just walked past a woman as she said "every time I get near a plant it just dies." Woah.
It's suddenly really warm in Glasgow, this is weird
Bout time snapchat got push notifications
Life is too stressful sometimes
Second night in my place and the fire alarm goes off at 5am. Great.
My first college related video. #adpr #glasgow #cogc http://t.co/K9xpB4goMa
I don't care that I'm up in 2 hours cuz I'm the happiest I've been in a long time.
KONY 2012
In Glasgow there are so many girls in gym gear but you just know they've never been to a gym.
@nommmmmi they're worse
The fat drunk girl is in Asda, good thing I blend so well with the hundreds of black Scottish people here...
Just whacked my head off a sign
Why does the police station lobby smell like weed?
Been having the worst "sleep" ever. Should've just gone to loft.
@Wendinabox your house asks you questions??
Changing accommodation two days before I'm suppose to move in. #yoloingsohardmyswagmightbreak
I feel a little bad eating this food on the train...but not enough to stop
I'm gonna miss my train cuz I'm in line at Burger King.
@laurenafterall whatever. He's still way too skinny to be me
The movie always buffers at the worst moment
What a weird position to die in. #ac3 #xbox #stiff #leg http://t.co/GbvDqQ2eCT
@MariaBurton1 I'm almost out, I think...I'm walking past a cemetery...is that good or bad?
Walking through Letham lost, how do I get home?!
You know you're tired when you try and stick an Xbox game in your laptop.
Booty bash
Violent derriÃ¨re assault
@chels_annie everyone that's told me it's good has been female. That's all I'm saying
"The Heat" was pretty bad. Definitely a chick flick. Watched 30mins then turned it off
Anyone with a car in town and wanna gimme a lift home?
@JulesDougs don't be late please, I have no idea where I'm going
Â£10 an hour. Wish I was doing this more often.
My last week in Perth has begun.
My feed is almost always just full of conversations between @HR_Clark and her friends. #socialbutterfly #misspopular
I sometimes keep my phone in my hand just waiting for someone to text me.
Just served a guy who bought two bottles of coke and a pack of thin feel condoms lol he was shaking when he handed me the money too hahaha
Just served a girl, who couldn't have been older than 13, with a lip piercing. What is going on these days? #toomuch
Glad I wasn't at loft last night haha
I know it shouldn't matter but a girl that dresses nice is my kinda girl.
Still awake.
@GregorBanks when/where?
Runescape.
Just finished my last Sunday shift before I move :)
I'm an idiot on snapchat
@_samspark you need to see a friggin doctor!
Bout to play some runescape. #dontjudgeme
I hate when girls compare themselves to things like a bald gorilla or a drenched rat. You don't look like those things. You look worse.
It's hot, wet, cloudy, rainy, cold, clear, mild, humid, and sunny all at the same time.
@_samspark I didn't get any text! I'll text you and you can delete all the other numbers
@nommmmmi no I meant that lol you always seemed older than me :P
Best. Birthday. Ever.

@chrissdonaldson just sat and read all your ask.fm tweets, I feel like I know everything about you bro haha
If you want your life to be a certain way you gotta make it happen. Forget that "if it's meant to be it will" crap. That's just stupid.
My hair is definitely not made for summer weather.
I'M DONE. THIS IS THE HAPPIEST I'VE EVER BEEN. First I just wanna thank God, second I wanna thank my parents, third I wanna say SEE YA!
Sitting on the toilet pretending to pee to kill time. #8minsleft
Fell asleep in the break room again
I have to wake up in 261 mins :(
There were some fine chicks in the club. #goodtimes
@HR_Clark I love you :D
If you need to ask if someone likes you than they probably don't.
@shelbyswanx oh god. Stop, just don't.
My favorite episode of Family Guy. Disney versions of Brian and Stewie haha http://t.co/mDeshEkkgA
Xbox gamertag - MrAwkwardlyEpic
Just saw a fat 50+ woman wearing a "dork" dress. I wanna cry.
Just saw myself in some random chick's cover pic on Facebook. Who are you? And why am I in your picture?!
@HR_Clark that's better :)

Iraq has a subway yet Perth doesn't. Think about that.
It sometimes sucks being a foreigner, I miss blending into a crowd.
Suns out, moderately sized guns out
Someone come to Sainsburys till 2, so bored
@chazza_2 in what universe could that be a good thing?! #canyousayconstipation
