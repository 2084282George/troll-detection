HELLO YES IN ONE (1) WEEK I AM ON MY WAY TO GLASGOW
@stinaausencia You betcha
Went to a Swedish subway for the first time in years and was completely thrown by having to order in Swedish??
@HippyHobbit Damn straight
I feel like 90% of my life is just me telling my body to behave itself like it's meant to
Urinetown looks like so much fun already and I want to be in it. So bad.
@shooooon_ Fucking preach it
I don't know what I did to deserve having @pastelcaI in my life, but boy am I glad I did it
@k_hughesie @BritishCouncil 'Delightfully utilitarian' more like 'we're bad at naming stuff'
I'm on the train and I forgot my headphones and someone two rows behind me is chewing really loudly and I can't deal with this
I know it's a big joke about me being a big ol' Swede, but me &amp; some of my classmates just had an ABBA dance-party whilst doing the dishes..
Okay but how fun was Bat Boy
My drunk friends started crying about cats  and I cried about Glasgow. I just want my G'town pals to know that I love you and I miss you
I keep realising I'm not going back to Scotland this fall and it hits me like a ton of bricks every single time.
I'm at lunch and my colleague is chewing with his mouth open and I am. Losing. It.
@pastelcaI Yes this will need to happen

I meant to be productive today but I've just been watching the news for two hours.
Washed my hair today. Also just dunked a large part of it in my soup. It's all about balance.
I keep feeling guilty for not working on my dissertation, and then I realise that oh. Oh right.
Did very little work all day today and then 2 am hit and I wrote 500 words in 20 minutes. Why am I like this?
Will never be over the level of funk on the Les Mis concept album
@k_hughesie misophonia is the fucking worst (i also have it a lot, and it makes me really anxious about my own eating sounds life is fun)
@HippyHobbit just brought me a chocolate brownie bc 'it's dissertation time' and I am not worthy of this angel
@Steven_McFeat if it's the start/end of the route he's probably on his break,  at which point he can't have people on the bus, no?
How does one become more capable of handling stressful situations without panicking asking for a friend
told my lexicography lecturer about my dissertation topics and now she keeps giving me articles and lending me helpful books what an angel

Tfw you want to go for a run, but shin splints.
I went to Zumba with my mum. Being surrounded by middle aged women shaking their asses is wierd but empowering.

Someone forgot a crutch in the shop today and I just??? Don't? ? understand? ??
The other week my colleague asked me how I, as a working person, could vote for the left party in the last election and I'm still laughing
I killed a wasp today and I still feel bad, though tbf it didn't listen when I told it to get out of my house.
Best part about eating in the staffroom is hearing literally everyone complaining about awful costumers

I forgot to save that snapchat of me listening to the birds at 5am and I'm genuinely upset about it
@isobelwhy @lamalamalamaaa but also Cooper the slobbering bulldog
@MCrampsey tbh at this point I'm more concerned I won't recognise any of the seen texts, which I think is less excusable, lol
Just dunked my new headphones into two separate drink, one into my tea, immediately followed by the other into a glass of water. Why am I me

At first I was annoyed that the title of Cawdrey's dictionary was 46 words long,  now I'm happy bc that's another 46 words to my wordcount.
@juliaboardlady I'm gonna reward myself by rewatching In The Flesh. So long as i actually start working on it.
@pastelcaI unfortunately not; I was too appalled to say anything, hoping that he would correct himself. He did not.
@k_hughesie Mrs Wilkinson: put these on *throws 50 pairs of dancing shoes*
@k_hughesie gemsefine
Tfw your train switches platforms but they don't announce it, so you fucking miss it.  Great.
I take it back, Billy Elliot was great.
I'm seeing Billy Elliot in Swedish on tuesday &amp; I'm excited but how are they gonna do solidarity without the accent? Like what's the point?
