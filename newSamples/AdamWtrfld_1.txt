Listen up, kids.
Sprawled beneath a shelf laden with classic lit, a crimson netflix buffer swirl lazily swirling round my grey, vacant pupils.

Dude on the street in a shirt that looks like a Slayer shirt but it says 'Player' so rad.

@SirGoldsworth James Goldie everyone, philanthropist extraordinaire.
@OllieCharleton Just watch it.
@OllieCharleton Pick a fight with the hardest guy in the carriage. Get the shit kicked out of you. Cry on her shoulder.
@StephenCage Hahahaha!

@DillonSteele Regardless, I just LOVE puns involving the New Economic Policy, lap 'em up I do.
@DillonSteele Course I did! Who can forget that one history lesson in year 13 when your our classes merged and I dropped it straight away?

@Ihaveamusic http://t.co/ftEN9EL2 - My favourite, takes it in such an original and hilarious direction.
@Ihaveamusic Yeah I did, had a quality time until I cracked my collarbone, but that was near the end.
@Ihaveamusic That's the excuse that got me in this position and the excuse I'm using to justify it, laziness just goes round and round.
@Ihaveamusic Yeah I'd love to man! How are you feeling for the other exams? I'm revising relativity now; for all Jeff's shouting - I'm shit.
@Ihaveamusic Hahahaha, mate wish I hadn't told you. Little Sam all on his own in an empty exam hall. You back in Manchester?

@redmanwinoshoes @OllieCharleton You don't know me, you don't know what I've been through! Every exam I ever did was grounded on nocturnity.
