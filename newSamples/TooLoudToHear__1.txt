Funny how Corbyn was painted as an IRA sympathiser and now the Tories are cozying up with a bunch of Irish dickheads.
Saying that the amount of Labour gains is outstanding
It's a daunting feeling knowing that the future of the country could be devastated by a bunch of bigoted old Daily Mail readers
Tbh I think I know like 1 Conservative supporter irl
Absolutely knackered today 😩
Paxton is a turd, interrupting Corbyn through the whole interview and giving May an easy ride.
Fucking racists everywhere min
So hoping the Tories get their totties in this election 🤞🏻#ToriesOut

@_BlackenedSky I do too at this moment in time. Another one after only 2 and a half years would mean another No vote and ruin the chances of
Hate the mindset that voting for independence is voting for the SNP. It's about putting us in a position to have whoever we want in charge.
