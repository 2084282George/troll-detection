@HE_VALENCIA Can't you guys make a Make Techno Black Again t-shirt? Would love to buy it along with the patch. Embroidered text would be ill
@ParadigmGame Watch out for "fake" Youtubers asking for keys. The third headline.

@codeinedrums I'm spending a week in London next week. What are some great, cool clubs i have to check out? :) (RIP Fabric)

@WIRED @daveyalba Stop saying "trolls" in articles. People that make up death threats, doxing, spread hate speech are ABUSERS.
.@Ninjanomyx The Ninja has risen.
@NicoHines Fuck off.
@gardensimulator What are the final 3 extensions on the right?
@0PN Same!
@Doshmanziari Very cool. I played this as a child and the bleak color scheme and the look of the monsters always frightened me.
@hhhhhhhenry https://t.co/d1glwLzYud
@lucyjamesgames Yes. I love @PacificRim so much.
@DaGabbaGhoul @gameinformer You thought wrong.
@aeonmag Dude, these articles freak me out. These poor people.
@DeeJ_BNG I'm struggling in PvP because of people starting with special ammo again. Other than that, private matches and all strikes updated
@RapperViper Doing this will cause damage to your body. It will cause rashes/deformation and other bad things. I suggest u stop doing it :(
@Ertt_ @Bungie @remouse1991 All this text is taken from the game so what are you on about?
@AndroidCactus You should really add highscores to the HUD. There's no way for me to know if i'm doing good or not while playing a stage.
@0PN sign of the horns  https://t.co/HSfjuo7QBV
@m4ttbush Loving the game but will you ever make a presence on the steam forum? A lot of people are asking questions.
@gamasutra Virtua Fighter is the obvious choice. I see that Smash is a popular pick though. Curious as to why they feel that way.

@codysherman When you deleted your site, u also deleted the code for infinite scroll. Probably tens of thousands of blogs have been affected
@gamernation89 @gameinformer But they are. Detroit: Become Human is coming out. Whenever a game is ported, they use a different studio.
@uf0s8mycat @PlayOverwatch @Polygon How do you expect them to make their money back from the time spent making the game by it being free?
@420mike0615 It does not though. Put on a mask, get in patrol and kill enemies to get candy, trade in candy for a new mask. Rinse and repeat
@theofficialcdl When's the deadline for the compilation or has it already passed?

Congratulations!, @colintrevorrow
@Leafy_Cam RIP
@cgbarrett Any type of auto rifle with high impact is awesome
@Bungie Changes to the UI as well as the jukebox and glowing ball in the tower really makes my experience more fun. More changes like that!
@SirTapTap Hi Could you please tell me what area those "green little grub things" that spawn orbs are located? Maybe put it on the guide too
@FastCoDesign idk, you tell me. I shouldn't have to click on this to find out.
@Emojli Which one do you guys use?
Why are you posting movie news? @gameinformer
@PlayStationEU Ideal for virtuous missions.

@DyadGame There will be sodas.
@DyadGame Lovely artists here! ---&gt; @barachan @kaoru_hasegawa @ORIA_9 @KR0NPR1NZ
@KrazyXP @PlayStationEU If you bought the game this week you should own the costume. Select the app and scroll down to "my addons".
@punkojosh89 @Theswweet @TFYCapitalists Crypt of the Necrodancer sounds like the game you're looking for. http://t.co/sTCUoFDLWL
@NicklasNygren what a loser
@DoubleElevenLtd A Screen size option like in the original games pls? Online is very broken for many bc of disconnects. #ShooterUltimate
@InuitInua You should put your embroidery stuff on Etsy or Storenvy. I think that would sell em pretty quick
@softwarelabel I saw a girl on tumblr wearing a Software t-shirt. Are those available to buy somewhere?
@theneedledrop Fuck the hair haters
I just backed Neverending Nightmares on @Kickstarter http://t.co/QED3VHSqsu
@SonySantaMonica Any game you're not working on that's being played a lot around the studio?
