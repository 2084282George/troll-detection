@frozenreeds Is the Julius Eastman Femenine reissue being pressed to vinyl? My god it is so beautiful.
Entitled hippies can suck a fuck.
@ryanbassil I used an electric hedge trimmer to sort out our hedge last weekend. Wore goggles to protect my eyes. It was lit.
@jt_is snazzy new dp.
@tomdark @IndustryWanker I rarely tweet and who comes out of the woodwork, mr dark himself. Pretty sure @IndustryWanker has always been you.
Shouts to the guy whistling sandstorm while doing his weekly shop in Lidl.
@ryanbassil I had the rogue tear pushing its way out of my eye.

@vknfuj Mr elusive. R u coming to slop? @lilydessau and I wanna know. Kisses
My testosterone is tingling with excitement at the birth of Radio X. Surely @dapperlaughs will have a show. Who's with me? #lads
@jake_hulyer I know right!
Why is radio 4 swearing at me?
@LiamRobots @timjameshp I know, but I couldn't help but really love orbital. Frankie knuckles seems really inappropriate for that setting.

@alexroadnight @_TheGryphon She and her team are more greedy than I could ever imagine. It ain't the 90s, get over album sales.
Fantastic work https://t.co/GpFRolHclx
Lovely stuff. http://t.co/NzwTQ7zWQD
@SimonMoorehead Yes.
Ignore the controversial distribution process for just one second and simply LISTEN to the Thom Yorke record. It's really fucking good.
@taniabum Sorry for late reply! Can you do tomorrow early eve?

@taniabum :(((
The sleepiest seaside town which I've been coming to for 23 years, and suddenly Alan rickman is on the table next to me.

@hc0nway don't mess with number one.
@timjameshp is that another tongue-in-cheek profile picture?
@alexroadnight Nah helped out at the cafe as they had loads of journalists for a dinner.
@alexroadnight @DeLauraOliveira Great! I didn't see Laura on the day though. Obviously it was over in a second, but atmosphere was fun.
Nailed it http://t.co/57tPKXDHHs
@AdultJazz http://t.co/2EjUnDKBjz
@_real_lies Yeah man, coming down with a few friends. Hopefully catch you afterwards.

@LiamRobots Weirdly enough, I think my Mum thinks the same. She was listening to it the other day. Will whack it on.
@timjameshp @LiamRobots Sozzles that I never replied. You can order beans or ground. The bag I've got is pretty great.
@LiamRobots @timjameshp Getting mine tomorrow, but friends say it's great!
@LiamRobots http://t.co/oFXeG8xNX5
@timjameshp @LiamRobots Yeah, do you not remember? I whipped out my sax and played that sultry phrase, and your eyes said it was forever.
@LiamRobots I always form deep friendships in 5/4
@arthurbeatrice the album is utterly majestic.
Only 24,000 more words until I have my degree. ONLY.
@Jenny_Primrose @HatteJ @timjameshp @Bestival @LiamRobots FOALS! Second ever headline slot and it's alongside Outkast. Incredible leap!
@HatteJ @Jenny_Primrose @timjameshp @Bestival @LiamRobots Parklife does look pretty great, but Outkast at Bestival is something else.
Wondrous http://t.co/fCkppKl67B
