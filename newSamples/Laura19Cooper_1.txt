I can't believe I've already been here for a week,the time is flying by so fast!
O my days really, the fire alarm just went off in our hotel as me and mum were sleeping and there is not even a fire 😠
I can't believe I leave to go to Kenya on Friday for 8 weeks! I'm so thankful that I've been given this opportunity to go!
FaceTime is a real blessing!
I love who everyone feels the need to post a photo of it of the sky like its never been beaut like that before
I can't believe how beaut Saz &amp; Ryan wedding photos are! ❤️
Saz and Ryan have actually invited me to stay over Saturday night at there house and I actually didn't even ask #FeelingTheLove
I could easily spend all day everyday with this little girl 💜 https://t.co/PVonrbgxwv
Love how I Saz cause I had a quick question to ask and end up on to her for just under 2 hours
Little Lauren just ask to pray before we have dinner, so she did🙊 she's just the cutest little girl ever☺️

No better way to spend my night than facetiming Saz ☺️👭 http://t.co/GYYIyr9Uzc
Honestly had such a amazing weekend!
Sleep for 12 hours straight last night, Catching up on my sleep after mission!
It still hasn't really sunk in that saz is married and is not going to be coming at all!!
Having the cold also now toothache 2 days before this wedding is ridiculous, I honestly have so much bad luck😞
Had such great week at kids camp, so sad it's all over but I'm excited to get a good night sleep and not be waking up 18 kids in the morning
