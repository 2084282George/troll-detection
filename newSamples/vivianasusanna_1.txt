The Ladies' FS was much more exciting than the Men's. #CupOfChina
Best tip to notice any mistake in your work? Hand it in.
What's the equivalent of taking a laptop out for dinner? I feel like mine needs a treat after all the rendering today.
@BrownBirdFlight Right now I justify everything with "You've got a sore throat, you need to treat yo'self"
I'm so glad this is a thing https://t.co/Oavgtdmo96

Having been the one always studying theory, can I just say I'm so excited to see people like "YEAH I WANT TO DO SOME THEORY PLS"

Every time I see a "Game Over" Marriage Joke a little part of me dies.
Sure, fam, I live with a never-ending look of disgust on my face. #ItsNotMeItsYou
My laptop either lets me watch 25 episodes straight or won't let me watch 10 minutes in an episode, there is no in between. Hard same.
