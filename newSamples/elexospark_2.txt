@Machine_Drum yeah but everybody knows there's like a 6 month waiting list to all the good toasteries
Hi @DJDJWILL @clairecichy
Niners ain't in the Super Bowl so I'm not watching
@maxhostile sleep. precious sleep.
@djstef415 i had a 1.5 hr rest in the club on a couch, but only sort of fell asleep. i could still hear everything
my #1 goal for today is to not listen to house or techno. 28 hours nonstop was actually enough for me for a lil bit.
i'm tearing up just thinking about this. too many #feels
but for real THANK YOU to everyone who has supported.
looking back i loved every second of it.
huge thanks to @PublicWorksSF, @ShawnReynaldo, @DJDJWILL, @LOW_LIMIT &amp; @HNYSNDSYSTM + all the guest DJ's and dancers.
üé∂In case u were wondering, @ICEEHOT is still popping üé∂

@NacktMusic ah fuck man i'm sick! bummed.
i don't understand why @Junorecords categorizes @ICEEHOT releases as "bass". sounds like house &amp; techno to me.
