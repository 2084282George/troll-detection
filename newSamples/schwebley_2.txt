Slightly ~ pathetic life hack: instead of struggling with grocery shopping bags, chuck it into a wheelie suitcase &amp; be on your merry way.
Everyone is getting engaged or having kids and I just watched in real time as my tinder age slid from 26 to 27.
Fyi smile lines are just your body's way of punishing you for joy.
@FirstinGlasgow increasing fares when most of your buses travel in 2s or 3s or don't turn up at all is a problematic move.
I'll read this one day but till the next I'll choose to remain blissfully ignorant. https://t.co/RMBkJQw5bj

I miss the twitter and app but my phone says there's no room left and won't let me use my camera to take photos.
@jenmdudley congratulations angel, you've got this!!
Current life snapshot: epilating legs over the bathtub whilst Waiting for a Girl Like You by Foreigner plays quietly in the background.
Got a call from a glasgow number who addressed me as "Ms. Welby" and were under the impression I owned my parents house in Fife....

Over the past few days I have been covered neck-downwards in insect bites that resemble nipples. Very itchy nipples.

My parents are so concerned about making time to buy food for the local stray dogs it's making me so happy.
@Independent shame on every single last one of them.
FYI, 39% of Tory MPs are private landlords. The same MPs which voted against legislation that homes should be "fit for human habitation"
@yelyahmcdonald I could totally get you a guest pass for my gym! I feel you tho, I had to leave a Zumba class today bc of exhaustion
Waiting for that moment when three scheduled buses for the same route don't show up until they all appear on the horizon one after the other
Catching myself complaining about the shite weather as if I'm not going on my second holiday in 3 weeks in several days time
@jenmdudley yas! What would you be doing it in??
Conservatives win #Angus - seriously the fuck yous all playing at
Whilst I'm at it if you voted Tory today then please never interact with me ever again.
The real unsung heroes of this festival are the men that run around selling pints of Heineken from a large dispensing backpack #primavera
@yelyahmcdonald this is relevant to my interests
Someone on this train is whistling the Special D cover of the logical song. I surprised myself by picking up on it.
It's taken almost two years to build up 27 followers, there is absolutely no stopping me.
Mood: hair half up/half down, in bed, in pajamas, swigging from 2 litre bottle of Irn Bru in bed having moved approximately twice today.

Hearing the words "President Trump" on TV always makes me feel like I'm part of a weird dystopian version of my own future.
Fyi Full of Grace from #lush actually does wonders for acne marks and scars, though every time I put it on I feel like an oil slick.
The tone of #channel4news when discussing the Labour manifesto is pretty disgusting. Funny how no one questions the cost of Tory policies.
Cooked the family a green thai curry by combining 2 recipes and making own paste for my dad to smother his in garlic and chive dip.

Another day, more daily grind of sweeping up ALL of the hair from my flat's hardwood floors. I didn't realise I was moulting.
Ann Widdencombe is the fuckin worst #bbcqt
2 assessments in on Friday and 1 today. 7000 words, all questionable at best. I want this Masters to die.

Stuck in a 10 mile tailback for the #Forthroadbridge from the Fife end, avoid if you're in a hurry!
4 hour nap followed by 12 hour sleep. Excessive Christmas dinner messing up my sleep pattern as it does every year.
Can't tell whether the birds are at it this morning or if my tinnitus is back.
