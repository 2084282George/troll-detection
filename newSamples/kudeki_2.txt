@kch but the new season that people seem not to like is my chance to catch up
@mai_treat well this is off to a depressing start, can’t wait for it to get worse!!!

@vinaeco i actually have never been but i need to shop there this weekend!!
hanging out w a dog and a bunch of friends in a record shop listening to techno, this is exactly what i envisioned adulthood would be like
popping by the club in the middle of bleaching my hair bc i no longer have any shame i guess
@SteveMoser heyyy!!!
@vai_pahwa somehow black mirror always finds a way to disappoint me, maybe that’s the whole point
was about to leave but everyone else left instead, it’s my party now 🔊🔊🔊
