I just can't stop laughing at how some people act 😂
Knowing you start work in an hour  and wondering if I could squeeze in a nap before I go ..
When I stay up late, I'm always starving 😩
You got my runnin in circles at night.
When you regret having a nap because you know you aren't gonna sleep that night 👌
Im standing in the rain and A young girl hands me a umbrella and says "just because" and walks away! How sweet ❤️
Only I would forget my new Twitter name.. 😂
🌠☺️
Sarcasm is my favourite 🙊
When you have a dream that feels soo real 😩 @anastasiamargeo
Can't believe I smashed my phone today! RAGING
Jb seshing
I never go out to find
People change in time
I'm in California dreaming aboutwho we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
