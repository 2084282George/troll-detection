Remember that year when Frank Ocean came second in the BBC Sound of?
The worst part about this is the suggestion that the suffragette would consider the woman next to her as uncouth. https://t.co/uaaIU3h47N
I haven't read this, but with a headline as thought provoking as that, who needs to? https://t.co/TjLzxQG48m
@vknfuj @lilydessau Would be great to see you. Do mobile phones play a role in ur life these days?
Sorry, I'm just finding it really hard to believe Radio X is anything more than a wind up.
@taniabum For the bank holiday or foreeeeeeeeeeever? Either way, my answer is the fattest yes!
@Josh_Jennings7 m8 I've had a hangover today that feels fitting with the aftermath of that. Yes to a beer! Been too long!
@UKLabour Embarrassingly I've only just signed up and like a thousand others I'm wanting to vote Corbyn but I see no instruction. Help?

@JaakkoEino creates the special kind of pop music. Absolutely mesmerised by the album.
With this sort of privilege and ignorance kicking around, it's starting to make sense why I awoke to a Tory government about a month ago.

Listening to the @hollyherndon album while walking through dark streets is terrifying and reassuring in equal measure.
Justice still very much non-existent: http://t.co/xQtiMEavL8
Surely 'trust fund' is a certified genre of music now?
This is great http://t.co/Z2XGM5rJ6g

'I'd fuck to this' – soundcloud comment of the day.
@NealonMary @Telegraph Excellent news!
@thomdenson Thanks man. Rinsed that J Barwick album already, but Grouper is a great shout. Shoulda thought of that myself.
Need a new album/mix to fall asleep to. Anyone have any recommendations?
@taniabum Next week it is!
Soundcloud comments are gold: 'I wanna someday stare into the eyes of their person I love to this song one day'.
@taniabum miss you too teeby bum bum xxx
Apparently Kate Bush didn't play Wuthering Heights. I now feel slightly better about not having a ticket. SLIGHTLY.
@taniabum Really like it. Hope you're well babes.
@hc0nway @MichaelJayHolt Yes! Thank you for everything Mike!

@Vondelife Overjoyed you put up vondelife mix again. It is the only thing getting me through these essays.

@taniabum Many uncomfortable truths here.
I love Mac Demarco and I don't understand why. The songs are tragically boring, yet I've been glued to the album.

@Tashieneals I didn't, but that's cool! Why the hell aren't Haim higher up the bill? Are you planning on going?
@Tashieneals My love for obnoxious hip hop has never made any sense. Also, your fave gal has a new song: http://t.co/ko4fOjmWyy
@Bradtukh I barely convinced myself with the argument, but just doing ma bit, y'know. You're the real celeb!
@LiamRobots @timjameshp They're like facebook, they'll always have you back. Already had an email asking for my return. Not for £6.95, m8.
@timjameshp @LiamRobots You don't need dollar, just get one bag for £1 then cancel – that's what I've done.
@timjameshp @LiamRobots @Jenny_Primrose OLD NEWS M8, but yes, she is beyond lovely. Collab: http://t.co/64P2YreBud Very R&amp;B-y
@timjameshp https://t.co/hxf40qXHr3 first bag order is £1, free delivery.
Incredible to see one of my favourite contemporary composers @ryuichisakamoto about to grace @boilerroomtv
@timjameshp @LiamRobots Tim, whether you knew it not, yours was a classic: Dave Brubeck - 'take five'.
YES http://t.co/MDWRkh5eL5

Just decided to analyse Kate Bush's 'Hounds of Love' album, instead of Tchaikovsky's 2nd symphony, 1st mov. YOLO
http://t.co/DXY1P9v74j – relieving stress since 2011.
@NealonMary Unexpected choice, but just as deserved as some of the others. Very surprised Bowie didn't get it though x
