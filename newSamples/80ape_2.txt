@LarryMurphyJr If you pulled this from an Assy script no one would tell the difference
@JDHernandez72 @sammyinlala @realDonaldTrump she's referring to the Lester Holt interview.
@toonarmydallas @Andrew4d @SimplyMitro Just said I was clarifying. You said you didn't get the comment.
@johnmarkpd @Realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump You find this analysis normal? Haha
saw mitrovic in a dream last night wearing a pink suit and he told me he was starting tomorrow. #nufc woke up hungover and late for work.
@LarryMurphyJr I hope this is true hahaha
OP-1 or Organelle? #synth

Been biting my tongue all day here re this transfer window. #NUFC
@Lallana_Pyjamas @SkySportsNews 6m is a bit harsh, but nonetheless you've guaranteed I will not go to bed.
@Lallana_Pyjamas @SkySportsNews As long as you promise Origi In The Morning
@Chalky_Whyte @NUFC360 Still, his record... worth it haha if he scores 12 with 5 assists but misses 6 games, I'm ok with that.
@Chalky_Whyte @NUFC360 Mitro's record is too good to pass up. Worth keeping and working on his maturity. Origi seemed tied up w Monaco?
@Chalky_Whyte @NUFC360 No coincidence that he goes on sale once we open up so much on weekly wages. Think there HAS to be a replacement
If Joey Barton elbowed Lanzini everyone would be praising his on-field leadership. #NUFC Maybe if Mitro talks about Ashley...
@NUFCThreatLevel Shelvey going bang bang on his therapy sessions
@TheMasterBucks @jobaoneill I live in Los Angeles hahaha
Long time coming, but just finish my first solo album. SEVEN under @PabloSwiss available to stream everywhere.â€¦ https://t.co/71FJsuYFtT
@AdamBeckett09 and Rafa has shown frustration towards charnley to create urgency. I'm not believing that he's a press puppet.
@AdamBeckett09 Problem is finding a suitable buyer for all these extras at a reasonable price for us to reinvest. Sâ€¦ https://t.co/RFP57KZsa5
@AdamBeckett09 Did u see any of the new signings in rumors? I didn't. He clearly stated he was not going to overpayâ€¦ https://t.co/tkOAOIiedT

@hughhowey quick question, regarding the music associated with your books. Do you normally use original music? Or gather playlists? Thx!
@christilton that, is a hard game!
@Lavanglish @JN09_ I mean are you referring to HIM getting paid or cash for transfer?
@JN09_ yup. Not like he's a rookie manager trying to gain interest by promoting us haha

@dcbashore he is at a disadvantage for wasting time. He's getting moderated
@dcbashore it does. They keep interrupting him for not answering the question. A good answer will hit harder than emails
@Lavanglish @eneaux @Taylorpayne @helloIamBesty @JN09_ serious FOMO
