@paulsmithmusic @Monorail_Music had a blast as always but wtf is happening at the abc #falseadvertising
@StTropezTan I love the concept, and It truly works but because I'm so pale it took 3 applications for a light result #binnedthefakebake

@PersonalEscrito @jncatron these are the people making the decisions to keep bombing, what type of mentality did you expect #NAZISRAEL
@ZazaFL something @BarackObama should have done first instead of sending over more weapons
Israeli official calls for concentration camps in Gaza
http://t.co/COJSzZJgsW via @MailOnline....people learn nothing from the past
@HonJohnBaird how hasty to blame......now this repugnant act turns out to be a death in action!! Are you going to recant ? #1700deaths #Gaza
@ShamsuAhamd  that picture broke me! Have saw awful, unbelievable pics but this I mourned  like he was my own son  #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza
@Khawarabedi quite clearly isreUS! How else can they explain the bias on the reporting! #youdontcontrolus #notblindanymore
@Drax the only difference is Germany didn't have the backing if USA! How different the world would be if Obama was in Hitlers pocket!! #USA
@ShamsuAhamd they will say what they have been saying for week! He is a terrorist therefore his death is allowed! Please stop this! Please !
They bomb the tunnels, tunnels that in another country, in another century, are the reason most Jewish people exist #GazaUnderAttack
If intent on destroying the tunnels surely they would be targeting the outskirts not the built up areas #GazaUnderAttack #NoExcuses
@revfsh it was appalling to watch! Hard to believe they have forgotten and yet ask us all to remember their history #actionspeaklouder
@francomorip I get very frustrated because I can do nothing, just a voice drowned out by artillery shells and bombs #GazaUnderAttack
When are we going to see someone stand and say NO MORE ! No more dead innocents  #GazaUnderAttack #FreePalestine #Gaza #GazaUnderFire
@mugatu78 @David_Cameron @tonyblairoffice Blair parties whilst peoe are murdered, obviously nothing to gain by becoming  involved #shameonu
@saba_shaukat a picture speaks a thousand words.....the smokescreen is shattered thanks to social media we see it before it's edited
@michaelabood1 and all Europe abstained! Shame on them all #takeastand #dontbeblind #GazaUnderAttack
@mavimojo Israel can't be!! U.S.A don't negotiate with terrorists!!! Didn't you know this????!!!!Sickened by the non-actions of Europe/USA
@David_Cameron where's your statement on #GazaUnderAttack you do know it's happening right?
