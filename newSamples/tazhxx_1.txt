Migrating to Australia is seriously on the cards
I swear people only talk to me when they want or need something
Can’t actually mind the last time I had the chance to wear makeup
Ryan and I are gonna be baby free for the first time ever this Sunday omg
So many people having babies just now I love it 🙊
Such a nervous wreck ATM
So true when you're pregnant everyone wants to be your friend but as soon as you've had your baby nobody can be fucked with you anymore
So glad it's Ryans last day at work again
Too much on my mind to sleep
My baby has slept all night for the past 3 nights now! So happy
Emilie didn't wake once for a feed last night, hoping this is the first of many🤞🏼
Fairy tale of New York will forever be my favourite Christmas song

Don't understand folk that go on nights out when their babies about 2 weeks old, why would you want to leave them so soon👀🤔
Keep looking at holidays no one has any idea how much I need one😩 so tempted to book one for us all
Managed to get @kevinbridges86 tickets, yaldi
There's nothing more amazing than your baby smiling at you
Howling and greeting at children in need
Can't believe my baby is a month old already🙈💖
Hate folk that turn everything into a competition
Honestly can't help myself when it comes to spending money on Emilie, I've got one spoilt little baby
Never really understood women missing their bump after pregnancy until now, so strange but you grow so used to it🤰🏽
Feels like it's been Halloween forever
I can't believe my beautiful little baby is already 2 weeks old 😯
Emilie is only 5 days old and I've manage to take over 200 pics of her already
Gonna be the best Friday the 13th ever
It's sad that I'm excited to go to Toys R Us the day and I'm no even bothered
Love a bus 35 min late 🙃🙃
This nesting malarky is actually torturing me 😂😂
I'm such a wimp the now 😂
Can't sleep, all I can think about is tomorrow 🤦🏽‍♀️
What an embarrassment 😂
So horrible being ill and only being able to take paracetamol. It does FUCK ALL
Looks so strange seeing 280 character tweets 👀👀
