@Bandcloud But can they yoik?
Teresa Winter's Untitled Death LP is amazing. Disappointed I didn't discover this earlier in the week... https://t.co/oBjjV8yl38
@ebauchemusic One of my favourites too.
@C1ust3r Sure. Putting together a curling team. You in?
@CiaranDowdy Yikes
@silver_surfer82 @ChiuauaTeardrop Could have squeezed some student accommodation in there too. Missed opportunity if you ask me.
@crankyeoghan Her new one is great.
@munitionsfamily I gave up toast for Lent. Just like Jesus.

The young fella is learning some new songs in school - Love and Mercy by Brian Wilson and... The Logical Song by Scooter.
@benjaminfinger Was intrigued by the sample!
@seanlclancy This is great!
If you happen to be in Cork tonight, go to this. The Dublin show as psychedelicious. https://t.co/7GDRWmPHIX
My hangover and I are spoiled for choice of Ann Hathaway movies on TV.
Let‚Äôs go.

@Bandcloud Gas. Myself and @weareie were only talking about it last week... and now here it is.
@johnchantler That ended rather abruptly. Gave me a jolt. Amazing stuff.
@aob_oyle I know! Always marvel that it was recorded and mixed by Steve Albini.
One of my favourite records. Very tempted to buy a second copy. https://t.co/EatLpoWRln
Due to some unforgivable oversight, I haven't played any Labradford on the show yet...

Any suggestions for a venue for a 50th birthday in Dublin City? (Not mine, I hasten to add.)
Ah no. https://t.co/PrjWuiLBBt
@lowtheband webcast, I hope?
@EXECUTIVESTEVE It certainly jumped the shark towards the end of 2016. I'll be glad to see the back of it.
@seanlclancy It's a rework of the theme from Dad's Army, right? (Can't claim to know anything about him.)
@Bandcloud please do!

@weareie Nice while it lasted.
@daramul Nice one.
@Bandcloud @PriorGavin Catching up and leading the way too. The Wilted Woman and Dalot &amp; Sound Awakener tracks are great.
I wish Tim Gane would stop releasing Cavern of Anti-Matter albums and start remastering those Stereolab albums.
@rdmnk @DabbledooMusic Got a link for that? Will forward to the wee man's school.
@Bandcloud the best kind
@lowpoint The new comp on Opal Tapes.
@Bandcloud I'd go and see it live though. Imagine it would be great.
@Bandcloud You like the new one? The Animal Spirits?
@crankyeoghan That's cool. Reminds me of something though...

You say, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble.
I say, stoned colliery band.

A bit of bother with my Out of Office message. Apparently, 'GO FUCK YOURSELF' doesn't 'synergize with company values'.
