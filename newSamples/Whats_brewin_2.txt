@LondonBio Lets hope this also includes PLA straws, which are no better.
@JJ_Sivu @cozzie45 @coffeeangel @KeepCup @foeireland @CAugustenborg But in relation to Landfill and waste? After alâ€¦ https://t.co/k8NqJyDdGk
@vegware @EdinChamber What percentage of your sales get composted?
@KokoaCollection Founder always sounds like the business is owned by a bank, and you're just a figure head. You can't go wrong with owner.
@knovelupdates @vegware Compostable packaging will not degrade in a home compost site, so your picture is very misleading.
@McLarenF1 @MichaelKors @alo_oficial @svandoorne next year's driver line up.
@vegware Do you have figures for the percentage of your packaging that gets composted.
@mrjakehumphrey @achrisevans the TopGear format is dead, just like Top of the Pops was. Don't bother flogging a dead horse.
@dublinbarista Fully automatic bean to cup machines.
@vegware is that in production?
@BrewedBoy try @PaperCupCo or Cup Print in Ireland. Both actually make their own cups.
Where can I find figures for the amount of Compostable packaging going to landfill (or actually being composted)?
Anyone else off to Anuga this weekend? 6,700 exhibitors will take a while to get round!
@jimseven As a coffee roaster, why do you get involved with equipment? This might not be the best platform for an answer, sorry.

Are we watching the FRENCH Olympic opening ceremony? Everyone speaks English!!!!
@a1_coffee Not sure who told you this, but there are a number of Ghirardelli importers in Europe, and the biggest isn't in the UK
Disappointed that another barista trainer won the US comp. Hopefully a shop barista will win the UK championship.
@jimseven It was a waste of time for me. Spent a whole 45 minutes there this morning.
With Fairtrade fortnight about to start in the UK, do we still need the Fairtrade Logo in coffee? Or are we beyond fairtrade now?
Were is not the same as we're, or where.  Just lazy.

"not sure how many can make it during work hours" Says it all! The SCAE is run by people with too much free time, a weekend might be good!!!
Nespresso machine for the catering market - http://t.co/n5dDNP5z
Looks like La Spaziale have employed the designer from Conti espresso machines. No style at all.
Last minute booking to HOST show in Milan. More meetings.

Always find it interesting when I hear the comment "The customer needs educating" WHY?   I think they are getting confused with marketing

RT @TimStyles: Everyday it becomes clearer that the UK could do with a younger-run, consumer-facing barista competition with active sponsors
RT @jimseven: Ukbc refusing to announce results until party tonight. There is a little frustration in the room.
RT @hasbean: We roasted the coffee for the newly crowned Italian Barista champion.... stunned......well done Francesco Sanapo !!

@cliftoncoffee  The UKBC needs a shake up. I would love to serve espresso as the  signature drink, without the limitations of the rules.
