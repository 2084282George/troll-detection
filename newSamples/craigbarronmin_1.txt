@ciaranjudge This is what you need to get when you are out and about. https://t.co/eBaayengSg

So today marks the day that I retire from ironing duties, after it catching fire I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best idea to use it again.
@NeilJohnny Well I have changed since those days. Probably not by choice though
Next Christmas I‚Äôm sticking to rectangular presents!! https://t.co/Si9cnFFs2y
@NotAnotherJamie How do you think I used to feel when I was the only non smoker living with 3 smokers. Then I caved.
Shit Black Friday Sales the day after pay day, its ok to buy Christmas presents for yourself??
@clarkwalk Oh god, @_cbxtr if clark finds it funny I'm definitely developing dad humour
@amy_putt @CallumLamb95 You will all end up getting me in trouble!!
@amy_putt @CallumLamb95 But she'd look so adorable, she's definitely not a girly dog. My mum put a bow on her and she ripped it to shreds
Is it too far to buy your dog this Princess Leia Dog Costume?? https://t.co/oDZ007cUJh

@NeilJohnny You changed man, you changed
Saw IT, thought it would help with the fear of clowns. Oh no and now I'm freaked out by drains as well
@NeilJohnny It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but my fear of clowns has now changed to drains
@NeilJohnny Will I leave traumatised? Just like me did after Gone Girl

Mother Barron has called me Graeme about 4 times today. Clealy @graeme_barron is the more favoured son.
Nightclubs should have an age limit, i am getting far too old for this.
@RossWebster_ 23rd to the 26th of September
I'm going to look the strangest silver fox ever, grey hair with the ability to grow about 3 strands of facial hair.
@_cbxtr Is that the one that Laura got steaming off of one drink?
@rohanNICOL Have you purchased the lazee spa yet???
One of the influences that got me off the road to becoming a Ned and introduced me into a whole new genre of music. RIP Chester

Hangovers do get worse with age.
I think this is the worst hangover of my life, day 3 and things aren't getter better.
Sunday done right, drinking bourbon with the parents. Who would have known that my parents are bourbon drinkers!?
Iv missed my 2am drunken pep talks with @_cbxtr
@_cbxtr because I love her, she's the one for me @mooseblooduk
My mother removing people from next years Christmas Card List. #democracyofthechristmascardlist

@LisaMacDonald21 not just uni, high school and primary for you
Got finished early on a Friday, rugby tickets booked for Scotland vs Argentina and Aberdeen for the weekend. Who's out to party?
@tootsdeville I'm sorry they disappointed you.
@tootsdeville how dare you. They are life.
@ktbenson @laurenhorne85 she's improving. It used to be only two pints.

So my 61 year old father got himself an IPad a few weeks ago, today he asked how does google work. There's hope for this technophobe yet.
@_cbxtr @clarkwalk aww thanks.
@Stranger_Things @_cbxtr they are releasing the soundtrack!!

@themashhouse any chance there will be more tickets going on sale for @ModernBaseball? https://t.co/BpmYdo97Go
@clarkwalk do not watch it in the dark. Could not get to sleep last night.
@clarkwalk that car will be missed.
So I downloaded Pokemon go and within one minute it had crashed and the servers are down. The wait continues.
Well @BiffyClyro that's was incredible. Well done lads. #Ellipsis
@laurenhorne85 you've also got the glorious bagels and stuff
Oh shit it wasn't a nightmare.
@_cbxtr @NotAnotherJamie it's ok, I'll embrace it and become a silver fox.
@ktbenson well you could have come to see me
England are that kid that you didn't want to invite to a party but were forced to and there was always a slight risk he'd go mental.
