@NiyaPerry Can always rely on you for a compliment
@david_s_barker She did!
"If you were a sausage, what sausage would you be?" #gogglebox https://t.co/USkfBuiHCw
@DaisyMcCorgray Better than judging on looks alone...
Shame to see another Gogglebox regular leaving. Part responsible for one of the funniest quips ever. https://t.co/nuS3js6iPL
Not saying Eastenders storylines are weak but their plot revolves around a missing chess piece tonight.
@gemmaisshort I doubt it, they're actors, they dramatise everything.
@DaisyMcCorgray What shows personality? 😂
This is my kind of festival 🍾🍾🍕🍕https://t.co/IxAimaUzB6
On a positive note had a good day with Facebook in Birmingham. Chuffed to see many of the newspapers and magazines… https://t.co/DNF8ryyEl0

Virgin need to update their website. It was all about profits this afternoon. @virgintrains https://t.co/NNyMnvTePG
@VirginTrains I did have a ticket. From the same station to the same station. Thanks for your lack of understanding… https://t.co/wTsnvMKswP
@VirginTrains That didn't answer my question - does Virgin not account for honest mistakes when travelling?
@GoodGatsbyy It's a faster train apparently so that justified their extra £50 despite having no interest in faster… https://t.co/akKRJVN6A7
As I tried to explain it left the same platform within four minutes for the same location. Have some compassion for… https://t.co/14edG2SP0x

Nothing better than your phone blasting out directions when you're in Google Maps just as you're walking past a big group of youths.
@molly_lyon Hope things get better for you quickly Molly
@unfortunatalie This sounds so pure 😂
@hannahchrstina That's so weird
@photokayleigh A reason if ever not to use that app
@Shhhewitt @davefreezer @pinkun I observe the important bits like colleagues on the television 😂
My kind of news story https://t.co/44Ob5o3fEn
@catness0  https://t.co/XNtdEqJgLT
@elroberts21 Oh hi
Retweet if you *didn't* feel the #earthquake.
@Black_KateMoss I can imagine, just amazing it got so much attention and yet nothing happened.
Awake at 4am wondering if they ever did manage to find Kony after that 2012 campaign 🤔
@Cyan_Rose You're going to get some interesting replies now
@Cyan_Rose I mean if that was proper English I'd agree 😂
Maya forgot to bring her purse, and Isaac is broke. Paying the bill could be awkward... #firstdates https://t.co/uFajNwICVD
That's the next election in the bag then. https://t.co/tkBrliB0Yi
@David_Powles @pinkun @davefreezer @paddyjdavitt Evidently the office wifi is already there.
So excited for the fact we're finally getting a #norfolkday! It was a big injustice that Suffolk had a day, but not Norfolk 😂 @norfolk_day
@Cyan_Rose You obviously paid more attention than me 😂
Pretty sure the Hungry House advert with the two guys singing is the worst advert on TV right now.
@blindandb0ujee Noted 😂
@catness0 Aren't you going to share it here?
@uktattoochick Could have been worse
@bex6 Not sure if this was innuendo or not 😂
@heyitsmaz Yes bit odd. Try just water?
@Shaannongraham_ Hope you got the attention you deserve x
@Cyan_Rose Thanks for clarifying 😂
@JessieHorne_ So confused.
@kayleigh_james This is lovely. I was in a pub.
@EllieJeanEsther Sounds romantic...
@thisisjoeob Positive then?
@charlottelmoore Ah but you shouldn't be x
It's better than flowers 👇 https://t.co/uFmAeAXcB2
And now he's started a rant about feminism 😂
Next to a couple enjoying a Valentine's evening in the pub. They've just called each other miserable f*cks. It's started off well...
I love that Instagram is just pancakes with a random roast dinner or two thrown in.
Meanwhile on local news https://t.co/y49CEpTRsD
Happy galantines day, ladies. May your evening be filled with... pancakes?! https://t.co/G1samXEKyB
@_BeckyHilton I thought it was someone's office to start with
I'm so bad at directions I almost walked in the mortuary at the hospital rather than the pharmacy.
It's been five years since George Osborne looked in disgust at a ready meal. https://t.co/oc2hLj2sf5
@YouMustBeAnna I find it baffling it's an issue for guys
@dinamche Go steady
You'd think @latitudefest would know where their own festival is being held. There's a 130 miles between Sussex and… https://t.co/KV3aXqPuLX
@YouMustBeAnna One that might have been held back a few years ;)

@NotoriousMatW A very small % goes to the wider population as the event is funded by licence fee payers across the UK.
@LeanneVincent__ You'd have to put up with what's on my other feeds then.
@hatttiegladwell Go crazy!
@littlefoxbark As long as that list isn't with the chips 😉
@Geri_E_L_Scott Have you been watching Marr in Spain? 🤓
@Annabella_king Happy birthday x
Thumbs up from #marr and a "that was very good" compliment after he interviewed Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt. Broadcast… https://t.co/OxmMkVPBV3
@z_hrxh Easily pleased 😂
Had a dream about Facebook algorithms. Ah the life of a social media manager.

@The_Caz So hungry now.
@forest_petal Sausage without batter? Sacrilidge
@Black_KateMoss Very fancy?!
@lucygreggs @greggs_d Tory sugar daddy? 😂
You go to the chippy, what do you order with your chips? 🤔
@zxxht Is this Leeds?
@izzierobinson96 How does that work?!
@niamh_mcintyre Haha, yes, it's like my love for the NHS
@dinamche  https://t.co/yt58hlHHha
@jakijellz This tweet is so pure 😂
@misscharlotte10 I just think it is a lot easier to use like Instagram stories. I don't want to press loads of buttons.
@_halfords It's a unique way to get people thinking, perhaps it's a default line
These are my kind of Valentine's Day cards. Post to the usual address. https://t.co/G7i54cDYNL
@molly_lyon Lovely!
@Lauren_Tye_ Hurry back then!
@Lauren_Tye_ Which one?!
@yanyuns Haha well I assume you don't mean for me, stalkerish if so 😂
@solasuaine Keep being you 😂
@solasuaine That's basically many grown adults Friday night
@3milyhill Congratulations on the latter aspect
@IanClarke41 @AndrewStoneDD Perhaps if they had served it cold the fire brigade wouldn't have been needed 😏
That's the way to finish your festival line-up... with Mr Motivator https://t.co/qQkdHr2l5L
@EleanorMPringle Pretty sure it's yours now...
@blindandb0ujee 😂
