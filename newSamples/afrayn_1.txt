What a disappointingly tepid end to the #OGWT special. Richard Thompson was there for pete's sake!

Our campus union is not UCU, but if I were still a member, as I used to be, I'd be on strike today. #solidarity #USSstrike
@DrFloraPoste I do miss letters and postcards.  But I am very definitely not in a circle of people who write them!
@DrFloraPoste WhatsApp, primarily, a few FB messenger, e-mail, here.  All data-based, innit.
Hi pals, my phone is, to use a technical term, bollocksed. Think only @DrFloraPoste &amp; @situationniste text me nowadays, but just in case...
@cathfeely seeing you pop up reminds me - if you haven't already you should meet my pal @chrissievmierlo, who now works at Erewash Museum.
@whollybrogued same for mine, penknives everywhere. My dad still uses a few around the house.
@JosieLong I will never understand how she remains a part of the Labour Party.
@chrissievmierlo wow, I did not know this. How has there not been more kickback?!
.@rachelparris has been on absolutely stunning form throughout this series of The Mash Report. Chapeau. https://t.co/echuSnc0yg
@EnglishLitHist I can't see how, in British English, it can be anything else! CAZ-a-bon commonest but doesn't follow pronunciation rules.(?)
@ScottishLit @AranWS but have you been blocked by Bastani yet?
As @PriyamvadaGopal says, there does come a point where you have to say "I heard; I was wrong." .
@PlashingVole glad there were at least some of the latter.
@PlashingVole the fuck?! That is truly outrageous.
Can't reiterate this enough. Nobody needs to inform management prior to striking. &amp; get your rep on dodgy "partialâ€¦ https://t.co/YlK9pPSsSA

@SarahRoseCrook I'll probably keep doing what I've been doing. (Trust that you aren't, in fact, Having a Hard Time and all's well?)
Remarkable coincidence with @vonny_bravo's article today... https://t.co/XkSGIZ6SlN
@vonny_bravo not that exciting, but good anecdotal example on bodies and shame. On hols this week but beers and guitars soon please!
Bodies are normal, whatever they do, whatever comes out of them. ðŸ’ª https://t.co/W42lXBTI4Z
@__Josefinaaa see also Richard Thompson.
@ScottishLit @TheScotsman @CalumMacLeoid @ESPNcricinfo is also grim for autoplay videos.
@davidmgclark only just off M6 J37, so worth a look if you're ever driving that way!
@davidmgclark didn't have time to go down to the river :/ - was on a tight schedule down to the East Midlands (6 hrs given a fair wind...)

@chrissievmierlo @Erewash_Museum @LocalHistoryCaf also, this is a Caption Competition style photo of me...
@elizabethunston @rachelmcneice ahhh, can't believe it's a year ago! Hope you're both well :)
@ScottishLit sadly, yes.
#onlyconnect is hella hard tonight.
@Southldntabby currently enjoying Cosey Fanni Tutti's Art Sex Music, although not always uplifting...
@Southldntabby will look at shelves for some inspiration when I get home. Just been reading Macfarlane's Landmarks, if you haven't already.
Or should that be not yet de-lighted?

Lots of top speakers already agreed, including @RandallBryony, Hazel Hutchison, @keatsandchapman @byebyepride @LindenBicket and Scott Lyall.
Final day to submit your abstract for We Moderns! https://t.co/zH01mTozaI @CLAWEdinburgh @modernistudies
@GfzW didn't quite hit the analgesic sweet spot, but no vom - so just about a win...
I was very struck by the sense of loss in both collections, and there's a very fun one in Sarajevo Roses on the nature of academia, too.

@vonny_bravo holler when you've got a space in your schedule! Glad you're getting well. Keep going :)
@BeccaEHarrison also, I made that really confusing by replying to the wrong tweet. Whoops.
@BeccaEHarrison all gone on this side of Scotland :/
@NuPopulism @svejky +1 to this. Keep it in the (e-)mail the general advice.
