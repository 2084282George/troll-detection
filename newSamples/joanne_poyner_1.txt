As soon as it's Friday my minds on a bevvy
@elliejclark_ So incredible watching your journey through drag, can't wait to see what the future brings for you! Keep killing it gal 💜✨
And they do. They really do and you'll learn to be the person to get yourself out of difficult times rather than relying on others✨
Unbelievable how much better my mindset is from a few months ago

Find it impossible to wake up in the morning without listening to music like how to people do it
How good are Saturdays though
Thinking about another early morning and full day at work like https://t.co/0OrJlX8sTv
@_MDotts "And how are you managing sir?"
"I WAS BORN IN THE DARKNESS"
@_MDotts very important and random... do you ever remember our convo about making a campaign for work involving Bane in a power cut?!
Can't believe I'm actually saying this.... but jay z looked pretty deadly at the grammys
How good is it putting on an amazing song and just absolutely belting it out
Exciting things 🏠🙌🏼
Just downloaded a shit ton of old tunes and I'm pretty excited for my evening of throwbacks
@brianmoran_me I aspire to be your level of lazy 🙌🏼
Hate it when you actually feel no bad about yourself and then end up spending too much time on social media and feel like a potato
Me asf https://t.co/Ag7HxeiziM
Forgot how wonderful this show is im so happy right now
That 70's Show is so underrated 👌🏻
@OriginalBruise You can absolutely do it. I believe in you bby 💜
January is so depressing, I want to go out and have fun 🎉
Love actually and a cuppa ✨✨
What do you want from me?!
So excited to spend the next few days in my pjs eating food and watching movies
I feel like so many people had a shite 2017 and I feel we need to make 2018 at least half decent
2 day hangover and just sliced my finger open 😷today is not a good day
I shouldn't be allowed to drink
@marxnie @_MDotts I second this statement
I really want it to snow in Perth so bad
It is unacceptable to be going to work at this hour
2018 New Years resolution : GIVE NO FUCKS
Like seriously can my mind just give me a fucking break for two minutes and not play tricks on me
Love a cheeky Monday off 👌🏻
What the fuck happened to me last night
@tessdewar Don't know if I'm going mad or just really happy but be good to yourself chicka you're awesome. Also see me soon pls 💜💜
Like honestly been such a crappy up and down year, bring me the booze and let me end it with 12 bottles of prosseco
Still can't believe how perfect today turned out to be ✨ https://t.co/Iqd9PxgZP8
Ryan's such a wee gem taking me to the train station to say goodbye 💜
Still can't believe I met my absolute queen last night ✨💜 https://t.co/NhaQdB3ZWk
I am tragic
Like seriously I'm like squished against the wall trying to create some distance between us eugh
Terrifying I'm only two days away from my photo shoot with the academy
I don't want to leave Glasgow
Where's the dewy glowy look it's meant to give you?! Literally like a matte foundation.

@XLXVXX 😭💜✨
Glasgow is always so much fun
Burning yourself with the straighteners is the absolute worst
So gutting when you think you're next to see the doctor and you get all your stuff together and they call someone else's name...
It's only half 5 and I already want to go to my bed haha
Like there's no way that any of the things that happened could in any way be real but I'm still raging
✨ https://t.co/0qXOIL81oC
Wish I was the kind of person that just wasn't phased by anything in life hahaha
Like seriously look at him https://t.co/cf1QQgaXNB
The unnecessary death of Charlie Countryman is honestly one of the best movies gives me chills every time
Hate when you have a dream about someone and you wake up raging at them
People must be bored of my ramblings about feeling more positive but it's honestly such a great feeling
People just don't surprise me anymore so predictable
It's unbelievable what a few months can do when it comes to changing your mindset and your mood ✨
Mornings are not for me
So nice when you actually start feeling really good in yourself and actually feeling positive again ✨
@jordanblackley We'll see how long it lasts..
First weekend of sober October is out of the way 🙌🏼
What more could you want?!
Yessss sing it to me Nicki
Why is your bed always 10000x more comfortable and warm when you need to get up 😩😩
Geez a flat
So hard to get up in the mornings when it's dark and cold like this... keep me in bed! 😰
