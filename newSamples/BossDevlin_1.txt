First impression of Nashville nightlife: people are actually trying really hard to talk over this band
Human brain: balancing two competing ideas is the sign of an intellectual.

Galaxy brain: only a billionaire can be the voice of the people
@IMAndrey i like your banner photo by the way that's some OG Candlemaker Row shit
@IMAndrey costs are low bc a lot of rappers dont pay producers or engineers so they can blow their advance on marketing and shenanigans
@bschaeffer12 Marc Gasol. Andrew VanWyngarden went here in (middle) school
They have let their country down https://t.co/96mFEU6DxK
@QuirkyGriff @CraigSJ loool this is still confusing me but now I think it's between two trailers and Tupac is coming out the door of one
@BossDevlin If you want to be a successful rapper/DJ get a manager with friends in the SEC circuit
Crazy how it seems like the highlight of some people's lives is their daily joke about how they feel about certain days of the week
@sophiefkemp *very kendrick voice*: Get 1000 emails on the weekend, the weekend / if it ain't advance then I won't read it, won't read it
@brandonstosuy nothing ominous here... https://t.co/r7I3qBIlTE
@ajswilley it's like real life turned into The Simpsons and the shows not even off the air yet
@NA_recs @tristan_bath feels like girth is the Chad thing to do these days. The last restrained media I consumed was Reservoir 13 (üëåüèª)
2018: teachers have guns.
2025: teachers need guns.
2030: teachers need military exp.
2040: school is military.
2050: school is gun factory.
@totalvibration also....a little late on the hellenic busts?
@totalvibration 15 yo old is here for this....some thoughts: 1) same lyrics, same tuning 2) At least the electronics guy is doing something
@tristan_bath Used to appreciate length for depth but now that I think about it few projects really hit that mark and so many languish...
So Memphis, Tennessee has the most underrated music festival in America. $125 and you can see Tyler, Erykah, Jack White, and David Byrne.
@FluffehAdam @hannahchrstina It's ridiculous because individual lecturers are clearly not at fault. Many are adjuncts
@SWXRVX aaaaaaaaaaand the president once again obviously has nothing to offer this debate.
Lounge jazz Pink + White on NPR for the drive home in the pouring rain
@MemphisFlyer the story of local business is skipping the puns to wedge that area code in there
@highaurad @totalvibratio demo is an equally odd choice, an industry term. Can we start using "snacks" instead?
I mean stuff slips through cracks but how much music are we trynna make pointless blurbs about? Ohhhh, you mean *your* music
Yo if you know any famous rappers who want to learn how to do steezy shuvits and kickflips I charge low, low rates starting at $500/hr

@panaman16 @polarburr92 @GavelHunter @JayWBZ you're nuts dude. Research Juan Per√≥n. If a tyrant takes over the US, ur gonna want to bail.
@HCantrece @ryanpoe I don't doubt it. Both Council and PaintMemphis have dug themselves a hole by not giving proper compensation
A tragic result of intolerance is people aren't able to be exposed to diverse art...and this happens way to often https://t.co/COpsdgO2ub
@aceckhouse unfortunately it looks like federal infrastructure $ will go to repairing roads. Nashville, for ex, is funding rail themselves
@speriod write-in vote: cheddar japape√±o (throw some meat in between)
@ryanpoe key issue missing is comp. The offending artist said "if you decide what I paint, it's a commission, and you need to pay" (paraphr)
Alternative take: nobody sings the national anthem anymore
It's ridiculous how, out of 30 million users, you've staked your territory as the most boring by a huge margin https://t.co/zzCdAuk5eM
@PhilipSherburne Listening to them would still be about as enjoyable as babysitting Jamie Twenty in a k hole
This is the quite the gamble... https://t.co/tT31a3EWoV
@Ushanka402 @PhillipBankss wow same this is chilling
2017 was the year I indulged in fine sweatpants
@coreyreynoldsLA aw that sounds great. Would love to hear it.

the 10 memes are:
1. Starbucks white girl
2. "Got any ket?" DJ guy 
3. Can I speak to the manager
4. "Rise &amp; shine, son!" in New Balances
@alshipley @TamaraJanelle teens in 30 years: lol who else's dad had the *exact same* otterbox case on their iPhone 5 so crazy!
@sophiefkemp @ZacharyLipez UK can vote at 16 and teens chose Remain. Young voices could balance things and educate them early.

@3liza Europeans are "rich" but heavily taxed so they mistakenly believe if they move to the US they'll be even richer (and huge backyards)
@Noahpinion atm I keep in touch with close friends via Messenger, Instagram. Prfsnl contacts via email. FB has become a strip mall of ads

@sophiefkemp @Bandcamp hahaha oh my god
Anyone who wants hang and hear music is welcome with me. Idc where you're from. But a lot of venues don't operate that way. They care A LOT.
So I guess my point is Sofar Sounds gets dissed as the capitalist AirBnB of gigs but they've achieved something many scenes could learn from
Organization was very professional and everyone was extremely kind and respectful of the space. They set up in one hour and were gone by 945
Hosted a Sofar Sounds in my apartment last night. Here are some thoughts on that...
If your senator doesn't have an F rating from the NRA you have the power to vote him out.
@GalleyGreenwood true I didn't  clock that. He gets in the crowd for that one line? But these days all celebrities feel Chosen, don't they?
@GalleyGreenwood nah imo he just did the damn thing. There wasn't much allusion to any higher calling + he was in a bouncy castle!!!
Y'all thought Drake would cheese his way out but he upgraded himself to Santa Claus so dude's basically untouchable now
@tabsout techno markets been taking a beating lately

@alshipley every high school has kids that joke about who would be most likely to do it. Humor coping mechanism for being constantly on edge

@GalleyGreenwood some of his words really moved me. I love Jim Wise and Pray for Newtown made me pull over in my car

Believe it or not, having your tweet go viral and then replying with "while you guys are here..." is not a great way to promote your music

@retreats ah I see. I also noticed that despite their dedication/drive the women were putting their name out there unsolicited a lot less
@retreats I'm not surprised‚Äîi think white dudes patrol job openings. Do you think awareness of the position might prevent diverse apps?
@retreats curious if this is reflective of the industry average?
