Officially members of @parkhead_naz - excited for the year ahead 🎉🙌🏼
@rach_hopper Awk not bad, not sick everyday now which has been nice. Hoping for a gentler third trimester haha! How’s Robyn? Xxxxx
@CReid1984 😂😂 the baby had a good kick when I laughed at this!
“Third trimester” or “how much can i eat while lying horizontally before I’m physically sick.”
@Julz2k5 Just made Iain watch this from season 1 😩
Seeing the prices of US healthcare makes me even more thankful to be having a baby in Scotland. Protect the NHS! ❤️

Officially have the pregnant lady waddle 🤰🏼🐧
Everytime I try to catch a wee nap my kid decides to kick as hard as he can on my bladder non-stop. Starting to feel like it’s on purpose 🙃
Weep with Me by @rendcollective is one of the best, most honest, relatable worship songs I've heard in ages.
The first half of this year is gonna be a slog. The second half is gonna be g l o r i o u s.
Everyone needs a pal like @bequietamy to have mutual counselling sessions with 😂

I love days when I get so overwhelmed with uni then bump gives me a wee (big) nudge and reminds me it’s really not that important. #cmonMay
@that1mum I used to work out like 3x a week I attempted the gym like 3 times when I was between 9 and 12 weeks and… https://t.co/MCpKT0W6kn
Iain was talking to the baby bump and said "you're going to like me more than your mum cause I'm fun and she's creepy and mean"🙃🙃
@SusannaHawkins1 @tim_fall Thankyou! Still a while to go but good to hear you had an easy wee boy. We’re expecting a boy too! ❤️
Guys being pregnant is really hard, you don’t glow and you cry, spew and sleep all the time.
Today I got up, got showered, changed and went for lunch with my bestie. Celebrating little victories 🎉 #pregnancyisexhausting
See if someone gave me a wrap or burger with the bread swapped for lettuce or avocado I think I’d actual throw it over them 😩
Currently staring at my clothes resisting every urge to throw them all out cause nothing fits me and everything is uncomfortable. 😩
2 months until I finish placement. 4 months until my due date. 9 months until holidays. Mon 2018. 🎉
@neevcochrane Also look at the fake tan 😂
Just booked our first family holiday  for September 👫👶🏻✈️🇪🇸
@Lacarcagne So-called Heathens often show more of Christ’s character than Christians!
@bequietamy Mate I’d be withholding rent, speak to mark canning and see what you’re legally entitled to

@shonfaye @coffeespoonie is a really moving writer. Not UK based but as a UK based abled I’ve learned a lot from her.

@GingeyRamsay ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ perfect end to 2017
Activist/social justice/feminist pals, what kids books would you recommend? Tories need not apply. 😅

Working from home is almost impossible when you have a really cute puppy that just wants to sit on your baby bump all day long...
Nap 3 of the day 😴 #pregnantchristmas

Self care tips: tidy up, listen to loud music, turn on fairy lights, light candles, have a dance then your feet up and listen to John Mayer
Today has taught me that people are the absolute worst and the home office are racist bastards. Merry Christmas everyone.
@GregorBanks @bequietamy Sadly not! No brie, camembert, blue cheese... christmas may as well be cancelled!
@bequietamy Can't have any cheese that's got mould on it and the outside of brie is a kind of mould :(
