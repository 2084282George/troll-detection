@AnnabelYoxall Usually perspective or distraction works best. Trying the latter, not quite working. Hope you're okay
@sara_linho I am thanks, work has kept me distracted which is good!
@sara_linho Best way to be, even if you don't get the outcome you want at least you can say you did your best and was truthful.
@Kaf17 Oh no, typical! I'm ok, back to work today so hopefully that will distract me.
@Kaf17 Ah sorry to hear you've been sent downwards, try and counter it with something that will cheer you up, make you laugh.
