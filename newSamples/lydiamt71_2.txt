@AutismAwareAus @smh he's Australia's Kevin Spacey, using autism as a shield. Having Autism has nothing to do with abusive behaviour!
As an ASD parent I know that having autism does not make someone abusive or a sexual predator. He should be doubly ashamed. #DonBurke
@LeBongJames @jolomonaco @RobCopenhaver @jaketapper no, it places the onus on the women. Sorry THEY feel bad, not I did the wrong thing.
@abcnews Excuse me???
@lenadunham PLEASE GO AWAY.
@tomandlorenzo @womensmarch @CSiriano @lsarsour @glamourmag I'm sorry guys but this lady has said terrible things. Please don't promote her.
@jjenningsUSA @Bowler1961 @DrJenGunter @JJohnsonLaw this statement is impossibly YUCK ü§¢ clean your mind sir!
@tjfoxx_ @dinahskarma they were looked Caucasian. My point was I've seen skin that was white/fair tanned very dark.
@dinahskarma @tjfoxx_ when I was in Thailand I saw a few Europeans who were practically black skinned from months and months of sun.
@midlandsound who said romance was dead?
@stucknLAwzmbies @charlescwcooke no compliance was high. Also criminal market here mostly organised crime, very small % of pop.
@tariqnasheed this statement is the epitome of stupid.
@jpodhoretz I'd also argue that Jamie (a man who's done dumb things) made his most intelligent move in the series by leaving KL and Cersei!
@todrick I thought that was you! Awesome!üôå
@JohnSafran @Mamamia cant as i dont want to give mamamia the click, what is it?
@youngmallgrab all in good faith, with only a little sarcasm intended. Like your music, taste in food possibly questionable üòÅ
@midlandsound take or leave it, I'm sure it will turn out respectable.
@melaninbarbie this 'argument' is reductionist, ahistorical and unhelpful.

@realDonaldTrump fake news.
@fuggirls @vulture it's a 'persona' a la Ali G. He's been doing versions of it for yrs. Check old YouTube interviews. He's joking people!
@jimgeraghty absent moral compass?
@seanhannity history remembers. Vichy America.
@CHANEL predictable, somewhat dull.
@Ripperton will there be a boring b-plot involving emails tho?
@sasha_velour @AssistantVelour @papa_velour @sfoasis beautiful.
@sethtroxler try applying your logic to another art form like film, less wom &amp; POC cast bec less interested in acting/watching? Nope. IDTS.
@Birmo can you please confirm whether you agree or disagree with @PaulineHansonOz statement on kids with asd in MS classrooms? Thank you.
@awerealis @PaulineHansonOz @BenFordham @SydneyLive2GB There still is. ASD is a spectrum, kids may be in MS class or special unit or a mix.
@dcash781 @PaulineHansonOz UNTRUE. I have absolute knowledge about what I'm talking about on this matter, what's your evidence?
@ElaineHerold @creativeelc @PaulineHansonOz do you have a child with asd? Do you have any experience with the issue? Please enlighten us?
@shotwithsoju @ajaqueen totally agree. I will say it again, 'I didn't read her, I aggressively complimented her' gives me life, more please!
@FoxNews @ericbolling @POTUS is ignorance of law an acceptable defence of law breaking in US? It's not in Australia, maybe different in US?
@shotwithsoju I feel like ru would never give up control, seems like a big part of her personality? I agree it would be fun tho üòΩ
@JackPosobiec you don't have a clue, I'm lucky to live in a country with sensible gun control laws and wouldn't want it any other way.
@mtracey @A2Jess wow, keep digging. It's embarrassing.
@mtracey @Landon206 @hartsa13 saw the receipts, sorry about it.

@RuPaul @warpaintmusical may I suggest 'you better Patti LuTone that down' as a new catch phrase for RPDR? As coined by RPDR recap üòΩ
@KimChi_Chic are you in Australia? That's a huntsman, they're harmless, so no ‚ù§Ô∏è üï∏üï∑
You better Patti LuTone that down: now officially on rotation in my house to all those being extra @DragRaceRecap
@5thEstateShow @Chris_arnade @Flickr thanks for this excellent and thoughtful conversation. It was very moving.
@jonlovett I like you but this is weak and a bit gross. Argue this point on its essential merits.
@normmacdonald read Trollope, The Way We Live Now, what's happening today has happened before. We're arrogant if we think otherwise.
@jonlovett basic equation üé©+üî™=PB
@benshapiro Big props for the podcast but had to lol when analysis of post election panic syndrome followed by ad for survivalist food pack
