It's a Sin just came on there and I have such a need to watch Bronson now. Bet he never had to worry about dissertations either.
@Aaron_Fraser it certainly won't be no Suicide Squad. Now there's an Oscar worthy film.
@Aaron_Fraser hahaha it's just my own personal vendetta. Good bits and bad bits but I was pissing myself at the Oscar mix up.
@Aaron_Fraser yeah man. I was going to start film and game ones after uni is done.

@Aaron_Fraser seriously though once uni is done you need to come over and play it. I am in possession of 2 controllers but not enough hands.
Wanting to get back into writing as I approach the end of uni, so please look at my last few tweets for links to my blog. Thank you kindly x
