Last night is a prime example of why I should not drink
Fell down the stairs last night...I'm such a fail
Just added up all the stuff I have bought online from topshop since September last year and I have a serious problem!
Just quite spectacularly fell down the stairs. Going to have some cracking bruises tomorrow 👍
My sister is honestly such a little bitch -_-
