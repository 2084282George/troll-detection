why are people saying things like 'i'm upset but that's democracy' uhm hello we're scotland and that wasn't democratic at all
somebody actually got off the train at croy, never in all my years have i witnessed that
a sad life
twitter blocked my account for 'suspicious activity' aye right then all i tweet about is what i'm eating
@lailah_razvi @FuseODG This Is New Africa!
my eyes will be bigger than my belly for life.
i convinced myself that a year out of my plan was what i wanted and now i wish i had just found a way to make a masters happen this year
can a downfall be too much enthusiasm? because that's me.
i swear the moon is oval and tipped around tonight.
@GreggsOfficial i really need iced fingers back
what kind of person do you have to be to want to hunt foxes? rotten, rotten, rotten.

i'm still RAGING at stannis. if the boltons didn't exist he'd be my least favourite character but i didn't expect him to do that. #passion
i went to sleep at 7pm last night and i'm still bloody tired waking up at 5am. :-(
life isn't fair.
it's 6am, why is my stomach rumbling?
@zxcvbnmichael how do you know i was originally being sarcastic? üòè
life is so weird just now like everyone is doing things and achieving things, the last 4 years have gone so quickly.
or at least not until i do a masters.
why is fox hunting an issue being dealt with? ignoring the million reasons that make it wrong, why is that a main thing? why? bastards.

'chunks' is absolutely my least favourite word.
proper envy people that don't have jobs alongside uni
the universe blows my mind.
nah. afternoon exams are tragic. i don't have the ability to revise the morning of.
days like this i could really do with a car. and being able to drive.
it snowed a few flakes 5 minutes ago. it's the end of april. why?
this is a sore stomach like i have never experienced before.
the sooner this coming week is over, the better.
my favourite thing about exam time is study snacks.
love bites by def leppard is my underrated guilty pleasure from my early teenage years.
when you accidentally type 'moist' instead of 'most' *shudder*
i want statistics done on a possible correlation between above average weather and falling exam results
current mood: pufferfish deflating.

baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me. today i need something more sub sub sub sub-stantial.
i missed sunny + warm weather üåûüêù
the medieval problems twitter page is the funniest thing ever like
frustrating.
last few weeks of 4th year of uni, still only read abstracts for essays #yoloswag
nothing more frustrating than glasto fans that think their sacred festival is for just all male white rock bands ugh
the quarter irish in me wants to get steaming today.
2 days into summer i'll be complaining about the heat (18 degrees +) but let me be excited just now.
charity versions of gameshows: 'oh sorry nope you didn't andwer right no money for charities today bye'

crying at the legal loophole in ireland which has made ecstasy and ketamine legal for the next two days.
