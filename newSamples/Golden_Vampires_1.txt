@CaraCompass fash is 99% googling 'velvet dress buy'
@CaraCompass @DanielHandler @BHelquist thank you Cara! I always always always wanted some unfortunate events related tattoo and it's brill
@Daiz11 then I'd say just take the year out. Either way you can make it so you have an ace time- just make it easy for yourself to do that
@Daiz11 its just what you'd do this year, there is no rush but if you feel you'd be stuck at all I'd do all you can to try start a course
@Daiz11 vvv true. Regardless of what you do, a LOT can happen and change in a year. Saving up money is nice idea but money is nothing
@Daiz11 Student finance?
@Daiz11 and if the 5th seems like too little time but you really want to live there- get on zoopla/gumtree whatever
@Daiz11 yup, I wanted coast and a vibe and I've wanted to live in Brighton for years so why the heck not
@Daiz11 do in the time you're there. London is awful to live in unless you have $$$ and even then so I was in the same üö£
@Daiz11 you get the grant as a loan- so technically you can have the same money just that ¬£3000-ish is now a loan
get up kids tonight at key club
