Why do bus drivers give you the look of disgust when you hand them money and they have to give you change? #rottenmood #buslife

Always amuses me when the App Store has an update for the bible. #littlethings

I develop a superiority complex when I am on a double decker bus and sitting at the front. #AllhailRyan #ChampionOfChampions

Not many people can say they do what they love as a job, but for me I am one of the lucky ones. #intern #church
Sunday night has quickly turned into Uni work night. #studysunday instead of #TarrantTime
Night in doing Uni work. #studentlife #SadTimes
Supposed to be studying....watching Man of Steel. #favourite #movie
My Saturday night, is kinda lame. Got in from work, read a book, wrote a class discussion, having dinner then gotta plan for Sunday School.
Start work and it was dark and finish work and it is dark. #SadTimes #NoTanforme #vampire
The necessary 5 min recovery time after eating lunch. #satisfied
#Thingsstaffmembersshouldntsay We  found spider in your bananas, consider that a free pet.

The staff cafeteria, more eerie and quieter than the morning bus. #morrisons
If it wasn't for Lucozade I don't think I could make it past 12 most days. #Lucozade
Feeling shattered and finally home and enjoying a well earned rest. #Harvest #Halloween
I should get paid like triple time for working during potential sleeping time. #sleepenthusiast
Doesn't matter what it is or how good it tastes. When a guy walks on a bus with food it smells like the most amazing thing ever. #foodenvy
If birds had social media would they call it Bicker? #deepthought #jokes
Just seen the avengers on a lads night out. #pre #Halloween #partying #Glasgow
The thought of getting up for work at 5am makes me not want to wake up for work. #sleepenthusiast

Thanks!!
@rendcollective @christomlin @tenthavenorth wish I could see you guys! But it would be too much awesomeness for my mind to handle.
Why haven't we invented teleporters yet? #scientistsgetonit

Forgot about twitter....
Scripture, an easy way to get to the core of Gods heart. #reading #scripturetime
Proverbs 3:5-6 a verse I am clinging tonight. Feeling really challenged.
Also if I even think about eating right now my belly button will burst. #sofull #feellikeapie

Don't know what the big deal is about Floom bands? @_DeadDreams #loombands
Week 2 of no fizzy juice. Life seems to have slowed down &amp; I have no energy to do anything. #offthefizzy

The universe works in a way that when I am not in work it's horrible. But when I am working the sun comes out and the clouds vanish. #fact
It's only when you surrender yourself to God that you can be free. #quoteoftheday #god

Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. Psalm 97, 2
The only thing Morrisons is doing to me is making my taste in music worse. Just bought another song I heard in work today..... #needanewjob
Home sweet home! Got the ultimate combo. Red Thia sweet chilli crisps and a bottle of Lucozade Orange.  #Yes
What a horrible time to work at. #morrisons #produceblues
Nothing makes me more excited than imagining what the future holds and what God's plan is for his Kingdom! #thekingdom #god
Sticky toffee pudding. Hands down the best dessert ever! #desserts
Went to the cinema last night. Hands down best film I have seen in a long long time! Loved it!! #marvel #CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier
My bible plan to read it all in 90 days. Day 43 &amp; think it's a great idea for people to read it all. Not even done yet &amp; feeling blessed.
Three times now. #HomeAlone
Watching this film as an adult I am realising quite quickly that the wee boy Kevin is a bit of a jerk. #ChildhoodRuined #HomeAlone
Home alone is on! Everyone stop what your doing and watch it. ( even though it's considered a Christmas film &amp; it's March) #GoodMovie
Col 3:23: Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as your working for the Lord, not for men.

@nommmmmi snap! What would make this better is if someone brought me a Mcdonals breakfast.
Going to bed tonight feeling absolutely rotten at myself. And it's made worse with a 5am wake up for work. #sadtimes
@coachjpanderson @melanieward19 they are stolen by dwarves while you sleep. They replace them with bigger ones. And that is how you grow.
Only 2 hours of work left. Let's do this!!
Sign number 12 of someone who is tired: Everything is a potential bed.
Plotting on my break where I could hide in my department to sleep for the next few hours till I finish. #numberoneemployee
Bought breakfast and am so tired a physically cannot eat. The task alone sounds impossible to me right now. #notagoodstart
Gonna physically die in the next 24 hours. It ain't gonna be pretty.
1 Thessalonians 5:5-6 ESV So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. (Shortened it) #Godsgotmy ack
Got a 9 hour stay awake tomorrow. Sounds easy, but I am staying up all night tonight, going to work then doing the stay awake then church.
At least when I can't sleep I am a bit more productive. Shame I'll be dead all day and be no help to anyone tomorrow. #nightowl
People who message you to go visit a site you know is dodgy. #whatsyourdeal?
Noticed in a tweet I have a spelling mistake. Can't be bothered fixing it. I know it will annoy some of you out there more than others ðŸ˜œ
Today's been going like clockwork. So far so good!! Everything seems to be coming together. #Iloveitwhenaplancomestogether
