nice human behaviour on the tube! but on the same train lots of miserable fucks were gurning and moaning and eye rolling at poor sad baby
the tube is weird bcus its horrible but u also observe some of the best examples of niceness in the world
I canny abide how rank my fingers are from sewing all the time
the panto gods are being very kind to me this season!!!!!!
day 2 in pantoland, sewing machine has been sent to glasgow, we're in London til friday
is it acceptable to go to bed now

I look like that face in a jar at surgeons hall
I've been on the wine since the interval, safe to say I left my professionalism at home today, but the cast didny have any so
