@adam_oko @selftitledmag @RossBlakeSound 100% ;)
@SighmanCowell Ahaha... look, those things are like foot yachts!
I can see it. Ghostly outlines of the doomed, fleeing the atomic firestorm, with Air Max 97s, still remarkably attatched, club-like.
Third wave, baby! @unsound https://t.co/WFyk0toDe6
@CharlesTrees Haha. Aww, bless it.
@CharlesTrees :D :D An outsider music school, de facto

Nuts, I already used the "Variety is the spice of life" line today! Oh well, hope you enjoy this mix: https://t.co/Uy19Xk3Psn
Every time I look at twitter these days one sentiment overwhelmingly and sadly comes to mind: Don't blindly believe what you read.
Honoured to be part of this lineup at the end of the month in Ireland c/o

@dalecornish @dontbeafraid Haha, I'm sure to forget something. But at least my nails are trimmed and I've cleaned the kitchen as well :)

And the man with the courage is @IanToothill
So honoured to be in this incredible mix. Wow. @FACTmag https://t.co/R9Gg5dquHX
If only someone could've told me when I was 14 that I'd be playing this years later... lordy. https://t.co/GUhzXr0hkO
@djchloeharris Haha, yeah it's salty indian curry in a tortilla here. Or fashion street food that'll clear yer wallet clean. Idiots.
I can't overstate how much I'm missing salsa after returning from the US. Fresh, fiery salsa. I don't know what to do. It's bad. That's all.
Good company, nice one, thanks @FACTmag https://t.co/oEv3fQYCLs
Meanwhile, back at Paris fashion week... Prophase Metaphase Anaphase etc. @loewe (I'll have the bat necklace, ta) https://t.co/v2KNfzGcxj
@gentledefect Open another bottle and put together a nice cheese plate too. You need to take your time with this.
@hmstulta Also have no time today for iterations of "let's love/heal/hope" cuz I'm sorry, love is going to replace Obamacare for my parents?
I made a mix for @Groove_Mag and said a few little things 'bout things. Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/skviADqclJ

A fine show from @MattisKD feat. guest @HadjSameer worth a listen back. Sick indeed. https://t.co/4VFlDXKUXf
@mmachinewwoman That's my estimate! My other half thinks 7-8k, but I did most of the packing ;)

@syncsmith I think there's been a crossed wire... I'm not on that list, I'm afraid ;)

This is really, really lovely. https://t.co/IBsNQStVr1
@JunoPlus Shit, so gutted. I'm incredibly grateful for all the support and can only hope for us all that there will be a second coming.
