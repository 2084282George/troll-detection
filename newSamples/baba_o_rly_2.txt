@glorbis My 33rd year was one of my most memorable so far, I hope yours is amazing

Got one of the comfy seats, with a cupholder for my hot toddy.

@Bandcloud Good to know. I might enjoy having the excuse to use up the remaining 1/6 of the bottle in one go now, however

Second day of a gotta-burn-this-PTO Christmas staycation and someone picked now to rip up my block again https://t.co/sPtGbDThuQ
@lefttheprairie There was some weird language like "homes for all of Chicago" but it looked like fucking condos to me.
Nah it might get wet
@blackmadonnachi @djshiva Oh hell yes, this has been great to see
Day 2 of leak. Was alleviated somewhat but woke me up again at 1, 2, and 6. I used to like my landlord.
@blackmadonnachi @basilionichols Yeah I think I remember that
@basilionichols I also don't own a bucket so I have mixing bowls from kitchen filling with gross ceiling water, ew
Going in to work half asleep due to surprise leak in bedroom ceiling that started last night, woo
@lefttheprairie I really like those on you!
Woke up brooding about work stuff in a cold apartment, but a brisk walk to Cornerstone Cafe is helping
@glorbis I can!
Travel via CTA to Steven  Warwick tonight: 1.5 hours each way. Still going. (With knitting)
