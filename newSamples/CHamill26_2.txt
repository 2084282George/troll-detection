@nxcoventry Hey can u update the 23 timetable on your site
@BobbieHallTV Sounds like my sort of taxi driver
@RobOgleby 😧
@exlabourite Bad comparison - money mentioned to mock Tory claim there was none, debt clearance doesn't contradict above
@CraigGordon1 😂😂😂
@MarcUrselli Don't be a Nause, some people are probably proud of the set up they have with limited funds
@exlabourite @mazehilluk Ah fair point, I was referring to corps as in huge multinational firms
@exlabourite 1) the company in your tweet isn't a corporation 2) that's in relation to brexit not increased corp tax ???
@GregoryDeer15 😂

@D_Libris have you seen his response? If so what do you make of it
@SamHarrisOrg podcast with J Peterson is oddly fascinating, would have been a better podcast if you had ran with his version of 'truth'
@laurawellz I think that's what happens when you do something you enjoy
@TPpodcast_ love the podcasts, really help my commute to work

@MrExposed @Independent bit of a push to say 'rely', isn't he saying if the option exists, take it? Bit of a blow to those with no option.
