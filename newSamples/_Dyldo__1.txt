I think I might be like.... over drag race. That episode was bullshit right?
RYAN MURPHY... YOU SEEING THIS SIS!?! WE NEED THAT SEX AND THE CITY THEMED SEASON OF FEUD BITCH.
I NEED MIRANDA TO TELL ME HOW TO FEEL!!!!
Once I considered pissing on myself in bed and trying to frame the dog because I didn't want to get up and go to the bathroom.
Lying in bed with nipple cream on my face... you? https://t.co/7mBu1SWRzj
I'm 22
Bitch I just booted up DC Universe Online for the first time in about 3 years.
Remember when I was briefly the most beautiful woman in the world? https://t.co/Wsk4ACKbN8
Decided I'm not bad at art, I've just got an art style that looks bad as a creative choice.
Straight dudes are not for me (no offence) they dress weird and probably don't know who Elvira is.
My playing age is literally 16 - 45 depending on how much I've slept and if I can be bothered shaving.
I deserve better than a man who doesn't understand the artistic and cultural importance of The First Wives Club. https://t.co/y3rIssVQlX
The SJP vs Kim Cattrall has taken a lot from me. But I won't let it take this.  https://t.co/TAzbMeLzOp
Urbz Sims In The City: Game of the Year addition?
My brother just told me he's watched a few episodes of drag race and his favourite is 'drag queen bob'

The opening number to cats the musical is kind of the perfect staged version of my anxiety attacks.
When the gritty sexy CW Scooby Doo reboot happens, I BETTER GET A CALL.
U ever fucked wit a bitch this bad sis? https://t.co/Ownr9qmL0Y
Vaping in the ladies room!?!
This is both THE BEST and THE WORST thing that have ever happened to me. https://t.co/9fk8CQOjBA
Murder She Wrote reboot but I solve crimes by flirting with men online. https://t.co/cwnznNOE0A
I'm the Nancy Drew of Grindr, men admit to crimes dead quickly if they think it'll help them get action. Police Scotland should hire me.
But it is fulfilling all my Bachelor In Paradise fantasies.
Jamie's gal pal he met in Costa Rica is coming and staying with us for a bit. It's like living in an actual episode of 90 day fianc√©.
@Siobhan_R16x our bird themed living room requires THESE https://t.co/1j8iM71lep
Me whenever I come across another gay person. https://t.co/71Jt6Ek4yY
@MattMacPoet Tbh if every queer person branded themselves this way it would make flirting with strangers a lot less risky!! üòÇüòÇ
Have those pinup sailor lady arm tattoos swung around to being super gay yet?
I love this pic of lady gaga before she was famous!! ‚ù§Ô∏è @JenMackessack https://t.co/igQgZzbqhG
Excuse me. Have ya'll SEEN THIS!? https://t.co/aOEnlEsfo4
My new morning mantra tbh https://t.co/WhPysoJMYy
Yes to all those concerned. I'm shaken but ok https://t.co/kJojnK8aP5
Courtney Act winning big brother was VERY COOL but now 4 members of my family have requested 'drag makeovers'. Send help &amp; blue eyeshadow.
It happened. After all this time. Kylie announced the birth of her child. This has been a wild ride! https://t.co/aixJHlJwW0
If I'm not described by at least one person as litigious before I die, I'll honestly sue from beyond.
My main incentive to keep living is that I really want to sue someone when I'm on my 40s.
I LOVE video art. https://t.co/gCLdba41SF
Honestly my main concern about AS3 is ensuring there is a top four who can deliver a both track to rival Read U Wrote U from AS2.
Not even trying to be funny I genuinely didn't expect adulthood to involve so many nights spent being sure there's a ghost in your room.
IS THIS A FEVER DREAM!? https://t.co/Rsnmh0qhPX
It happened again lol https://t.co/8u8mBXVWQ1
Sorry that wasn't fair, straight women make cool art too.
You know it's just SUPER lame to have your entire lifestyle considered not 'family friendly'
Literally we can't have ANYTHING.
You know I fucking love Kim K and you can say what you want, but she makes me laugh and that's all I ever want.
That green haters column has me CRYING.
Is Proud Mary the ultimate bop?
Nothing more disappointing than an assassination attempt that doesn't involve a catsuit.
@cobracommandy I'm going to give a gay star rating to every book I read, glad something stands to score highly!
Hence reading Animal Farm. I might do nineteen eighty-four next but honestly Orwell is exhausting.
Thus ends my review of Animal Farm by George Orwell. 6/10. Not enough Mollie.
Me https://t.co/gvuwn1uWPz
Which I think is iconic.
2. Molly the horse is a gay icon.
Btw I've just today actually finished Animal Farm and I have some hot takes.
Animal Farm 2 https://t.co/QDQkhQsfIG
@cobracommandy I once took my bins out in full glam drag but without a wig and wearing crocs. My reputation was never the same.
When both your low-key crushes like the same tweet. https://t.co/OYxhAPFhcW
The pageantry, the drama, the outfits. COME ON.
Purchasing a pre packed hard boiled egg from Tescos should get you on the sex offenders register TBH.
Making 'Britney... bitch' a thing was such a service to music
"Will I Am and Britney.... bitch" - is the most iconic line ever sung.
If you are a gay person who doesn't love this Reba as Colonel Sanders situation, I want to fight you.
And the fact that anyone is angry about it because it's a woman playing Colonel Sanders. I'm just shocked that this issue exists.
You know I'm genuinely so hurt by the world. Peoples reaction to Reba as Colonel Sanders is so dark.
I am shaken to my absolute core.
What the FUCK https://t.co/cHDjtIcGkG
Celebrated burns night with haggis then 3 hours of murdering my entire family at Just Dance.
@cobracommandy You've awoken a new crush. Why is the hamburglar such a sexy bad boy??
@JenMackessack This was a hateful and triggering tweet. She's an annoying bastard and her continued success causes me despair.
Green tea makes you gay
This is embarrassing as both a Scottish person and a major Irn Bru lover. https://t.co/nivi8X3PhL
Sometimes the feeling of getting out of a shower and straight into a clean bed can turn me on.
D'you who else in an underrated queen of pop? Tiffany.
@cobracommandy This goes deeper than I could have ever imagined.
@cobracommandy Is that a wig or a big foam spikey hat? I'm concerned.
@cobracommandy Leather daddy wig?
@cobracommandy 4 versatile wigs
I'm going to my first ever dungeons and dragons evening tonight, how many wigs should I take?
VR horror games are lame if I wanted to feel like I was face to face with a monster I'd look in the mirror before I have my face on lol
Just Dance for game of the year.
Ever needed to pee but also really wanted to finish your dance to the black eyed peas so you decide if you piss yourself it is what it is?
Yes. Gawd. https://t.co/lo7XrzXqbH
You know that scene in Batman and Robin in which Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy emerges from a gorilla costume to a very sexy piece of music?
Also her cover of yes sir I can boogie is honestly the biggest bop I've ever heard.
My queen of pop tbh https://t.co/Oy6xA4Zbn4
To roll a fag and make it too big in the bottom resulting in the filter falling to to roll a 'sloppy bottom'
You know life is really lame sometimes but truly I am so thankful to exist at the same time as The Elder Scrolls video game series.
People keep saying 'it's because we're working class' I mean... me too.. but I've never glassed anyone. Smh.
I'm currently obsessed with Danny Dyer and all his strange investigations into football hooliganism.
This bummed me out man https://t.co/Il45GqXaqY
The film took a third act heterosexual twist that eliminates all previous praise.
Before this there was a highly sexualised monkey attack scene, which had me genuinely shook.
Honestly i feel this movie should be considered a gay icon.
For reference it's THIS film. https://t.co/ELkuMdIygB
