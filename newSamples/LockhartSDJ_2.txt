Rare moment of vulnerability rescinded only to be reopened again so swiftly. What is this and why am I feeling it
@CLUBKELLYY 😭😭😭 brutal

@JadedLondon @escapetomars_ played a phenomenal set.  Hats off 👏🏻👏🏻
@DungeonTing That will be the day
@edwardfowell considered this but the prospect of arriving to work drenched in sweat doesn’t appeal too much 😪
New resolution: wake up early enough every morning to get the bus to work. You don’t need this early morning tube stress in your life

I am my own worst enemy
@SPURZmusic 😭😭😭
@DJSagePay @mistareez666 Mister Reece n DJ Safeway - these sound like speed garage aliases
Also saw one of the best techno sets of my life this morning from DJ RO.  Never did I think I would ever hear "A Milli" dropped @ Tresor
Couple hours still to go
I've been sat in this fucking Augustiner lodge forcing down the same burger for the past hour now 😭
@theteleflorist lol which night was this?
I. Want. To. Move. Here.
I'm not even hungry but the food options at Gatwick airport are super peng 🤤
@kush_jones_ Thankyou 🙏🏻💖
Today I learned that you should never eat a space cake before bed

People that go to techno events in London = people that don't live in London/live with their parents
@___PRAYER dark and dismal ftw
Really impressed by this Antwood album
Lol for anyone that's listened to last night's show on Mixcloud today - that's not the show 😂 correct link soon come 🙏🏻
Live rn on @RadarRadioLDN w/ this month's special guest Diego Navarro - lock in, it's a special one 🔐
Does anyone else get really anxious walking near pigeons on the ground?
@fareastsound Hoping they just agree to vet their drivers more and keep going.  Otherwise we lose UberEats too and that's worse news
Convinced my new house is probably haunted and have to spend the night alone there tonight
@limitedmitch 😂
@vectortrauma @reenaiswright yeah wasn't an option last night 😭 noted tho + caffeine tablet down the hatch 👊🏻
@spacebabe2016 Or a pretty small n unimpressive sauna
@James_0K He doesn't work there - he just wants to be on there. Thinks the track will make everyone stop n be like "omg this girl is sick" 😂
Whilst still begging me to play his tune, uh buh-bye
This one guy earlier tried to tell me he could give me clout at Radar from playing his track on the show  "from his talent alone"
@Eleanorgribb @ruihooo @HesskaCITS 💖💖💖
Dear Sian, it does not do well to stress and rush as you will only do stupid things like pay for items and then run off without taking them
@LVLSRVRYHI Need to stop talking about my spy on twitter
Can people please stop sending me grime tunes asking for airplay lol have you even listened to my show 😭
I'm never allowing myself to fall asleep on public transport again
@limitedmitch necessary evil (words of a shameful list requester) 😞
@kush_jones_ Yes papa Kush 🙏🏻
@fareastsound A lot can happen in a week... from both sides 😈
Only a week to go until my housemates are actual friends &amp; I can bitch about them to their faces w/o fear of being smothered in my sleep 🙏🏻
Why is it when ur feeling shit ur body decides to one up the fuckery and plant a giant spot between ur brows
I've been so absent from socials recently
@RobGch @LOrealParisUK 💪🏻
