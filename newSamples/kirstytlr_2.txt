Spent all day mid term studying and I’m still not done 😴
@jen_mcgregor maybe we are being healthy together telepathically, did a workout last night and had healthy food to… https://t.co/cJzarVhf0G
@ladycrapulet same and then realise then I'd be an illegal immigrant, but that is looking like a more appealing option tbh
Can I just say where are all the Timothée Chalamet’s in the world??

Watching the NBA all star game in the break of an ice hockey game, and I wonder why people call me Sports mad 🤷‍♀️
Actually pretty gutted to be missing sports ball this year can't lie
So completely and utterly sick of the worlds double standards, hold everyone accountable equally fs
I’m ready to find my soulmate now thanks
Can midterms just be over now pls
I know it’s many months away but I’m so damn excited to hang out with my pals from Home when I’m back
So tonight I wore my basketball shorts backwards for half the game, and now I can’t move my right shoulder back but hey worth it for a win 🤗
I swear cold weather makes me 10x more tired 😴
Already excited for exams to be over and that’s 3 months away 😅🙄
The motivation to study today is not happening at all
I would kill for some quality time with my family and best friends right now #distancemakestheheartgrowfonder
@jen_mcgregor @FreddyAmazin Accurate 🙄
can never facetime my parents for 10 mins, always ends up being at least an hour
Happy one month to Toronto and I 🤗 Very pleased with how life is going, here’s to many more months ✨ https://t.co/VEbciPIol2
@kirstypottter Would rather MHRA than some weird MLA 🙄
People who scrap all possibilities of friendships when they get into a relationship are such a snooze fest 🙄
Just 7 months until I’ll be on an enuwb night out 💔
Wish my best friends could come visit me here so bad, why are flights so darn pricey?!
2018 is gonna be the year of a positive outlook, lets do this
Would much rather spend time alone than have a pity invite to something tbh
Please can my lecturer from Home email me back and say I can drop a class bc it’s bullshit I’m doing 5 when apparently 4 is all you need 😅
Nothing pisses me off more than being ignored tbh, it takes 2 seconds to reply 🙃
First thing my dad said on FaceTime to me today was ‘Scotland got absolutely humped in the rugby yesterday’
Missing people fucking sucks, and I don't often swear so that's how shit it is
Grace and Frankie season finale has me feeling too many feelings for this hangover
I can't believe it could be another 6 months before I step foot in Scotland again um whattt
Gals, do not allow yourself to settle for someone who considers you an after thought or the only option left. You deserve better

I found a cute independent, old-school one screen cinema in Toronto and its officially starting to feel like home
Missing my best friends like crazy
Only been in classes for a week and I am already exhausted from it
If someone could bring me a big carton of orange juice right now I would 100% marry them
@filoujohxz Eeeee thank you my gal! Miss you too 💓
My dad is 3,000 miles away and he still managed to sort a birthday surprise, is there anything he can’t do?
