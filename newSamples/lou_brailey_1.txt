@JoshWinning @gwyntdc Guess what I‚Äôm doing tonight.
Last night I saw The Horrors live, today a new Fever Ray album announced. I manifested 2009 guys, thank me later.
Help needed: my work posture is terrible and I have lower back pain every day. I have a laptop stand/keyboard etc ‚Äì what else do I need?
When I was a young journalist I had an interview at the Daily Mail (lol) and one of the questions was how I felt about office ‚Äòbanter‚Äô
Hollywood is irredeemably rotten isn't it? Fuck all the men who've worked with Weinstein who are now shamefully silent. Complicit cowards  üëã

@AnnaCafolla @_choobacca Yes please.
I love the New Yorker but I read one article between Bristol and London and I still haven't got to the end
Sorry, more Tyler. Obviously I get that people are glued to this because of how intensely homophobic he‚Äôs been in the past...
Highlight of my week was creating a topical Konstantin/Wilson Kenney meme for private circulation. You?
@courtesy707 Soz, I regretted it straight after
Dinner: a bowl of extra thick double cream legitimised by three strawberries
That @NewYorker Hello Dolly review that became a rumination on the mortality of Bette Midler. I do that with Miriam Margolyes and Gloomsbury

If anyone knows what one does in this kind of scenario, please let me know.
Moral Maze was too much, I'm screaming
So in awe of the generations behind me. My 12yo niece talks with such clarity and awareness. I used to just play Megadrive, mute and sulky
Queer fountain of youth definitely a thing, guys. Today I was told by a barista I was like River Phoenix but with glasses üòÆ
Which is the better track?

@seb_wheeler_  Aw, thanks Seb ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sickened by the news coming out of Berlin. Friends, let me know you're safe.
I was having a conversation ‚Äì I was the one talking. Man in the same space responds, but directs his questions to the nearest man. WHY?
"For men, this can mean jeans and a T-shirt; women may try leggings and a sweater" Jeans + tee is literally the most unisex thing ever, no?

Listening to Jam City with wireless headphones on the Overground, my god the future is now
Not many words to muster about Fabric. I was a student with no idea what I wanted to be, I went there once and my life changed forever.
Todd Terje, Room 3, '06. I think we'd got there early and nobody was there but ‚ù§Ô∏è. Also that time I got stuck on the ramp. #FabricMoments
What am I missing about the Stranger Things s/t? It sounds like a knock-off Cliff Martinez score. I like it but...
@anomiseditrix @mslauralipstick The spasms have abated, but at least I got a good no wave band name out of it all.

I spent a good five minutes on what I thought was Weird Facebook but it was just a Lewisham Buy &amp; Swap page.
Used to be a big fan of @FEDbywater 's pizzas and spritz but disappointed by their shitty, condescending attitude.

That "Goes to Berlin Once Meme" is hilarious but why isn't shit moving on‚Äînot v #accelerate am I rite
Wait, is Maxine Peake northern?
Didn't expect to see my old house share, my old BEDROOM, on Louis Theroux last night. If those walls could etc.
Too many guys walking around in tracksuits and haircuts that are too small. You're in leisurewear, why so tense?
This is fascinating, on queer cinema pre-Stonewall. I kinda need to see Mona's Candle Light. https://t.co/xp1MjtEV6i
About to go for a run. If you see me, kill me.
@EBnet ~a million heart emojis~
Sometimes I really miss working at @EBnet, not least because of all those headlines I wrote that were puns on Todd Haynes movies.
@KLFORSALE You did one! Pithy yes, but also... quietly inspiring (in a non-naff way). Loved the bit about our brains furnishing little rooms
Went to pv of 12@Menier on Tues. Shame the video captures me and @Lord_Wozza on our phones like cartoon millennials: https://t.co/i5JjohuDu2

Journalists on a luxe tip, high-end-identified writers, look here: https://t.co/PupHpL6ExK
Pure-O represent. Why are people still conflating OCD with a mild preference for neatness?  Tiresome. http://t.co/lUGFX4sAtk
You know there's a butch drought when you try to buy Maxine Peake Jocks &amp; Nerds and the newsagent holds it up, squints, says: "it's you!"
@cybht @Batofar thanks for the tip!
My first club night in London in forever and it's a Pan/Janus party. I need to just let go.
