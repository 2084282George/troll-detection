@fffigs LOOK AT HER HAIR! The 2017 you is very lovely too though
It's draining dealing with people like that. I'm not ASOS, I'm one wee guy trying to do everything 🤷🏻‍♀️
I'm sick of blonde so I'm going ginger on NYE. If I hate it I'll just go brown ain't no biggy 🤷🏻‍♀️
I've decided 2018 can be my cocoon year. Fix my skin, grow my hair and save up. 2019 I can travel the world 🌎
@ASOS_HeretoHelp Done! Thanks
@madeinkellsey Hmmm yes, it's also as if you can wait until the day and spontaneously go for it 🙄
@chloerenwick_ is going to make me ginger before Christmas and I could C R Y
@kllsym NO.
@VerbIsANoun nuts.
How did the quietest week I've ever had turn into the busiest?!
I've actually spent hundreds going blonde and now I'm there ALL I want to do is go auburn and grow it 🤦🏻‍♀️
