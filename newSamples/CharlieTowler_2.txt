Glad Corbyn mentioned the good immigrants have contributed. To long the media has used them as a scapegoat for society's problems.
Corbyn - calm, honest and engaging ,May - nervous, deceitful 
and boring as fuck #tvdebates
One of the best new voices in electronic music for sure.

https://t.co/YgfnIP6beF Can't believe this is coming out man!
If May doesn't condemn @realDonaldTrump we will be seen as a country who cares more about power and prestige than values and rights.
After serious public pressure May's statement that 'she does not agree with Trump' is about as convincing as Corbyn on Brexit.
Always onto a winner if you are dropping Golden Teacher records @anu live on @NTSlive. Tune in great vibes all round!
@Plisskenboon I don't think you can actually decode a @DAVID_LYNCH film, he deals in mood and atmosphere, narrative is secondary.
https://t.co/XFwQy84Cwi
@LGS_rec with @dillonwork was great last night, one of the most exciting new parties and labels for sure! https://t.co/gyWuAfPCGz
