Not being able to sleep cause you're living under a fucking episode of Jeremy Kyle
Did you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?
Having the avengers in Edinburgh was pretty awesome until they block off the way home after a long shift
So happy to have spent this Valentine's Day with this dick @RobinoTheAlbino https://t.co/yZM2icOWNR

@RobinoTheAlbino it was a push

That annoying moment when you hide something to keep it safe and hide it that well you can't find it again

Take my hand through the flames
For so long, it’s all I’ve known
I’m crossing over the undertow.
For so long no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring.

Her eyes reflect like the rain on the pavement
You can wash the surface but the stain will remain
Every hero needs a princess
If the mouse in my wall would kindly stop scratching that would be really fucking appreciated
Incomplete, alone and unfinished. My flaws in design are all I've become
Think today ranks in my top worst 10 days ever
