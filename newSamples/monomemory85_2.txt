@MongolianCh0p Yeah, was considering revisiting. But if I can‚Äôt hit 60, what‚Äôs the point?
So it‚Äôs looks like you need a 1080ti / high-end Intel CPU to run at 60fps on high settings, given the current resul‚Ä¶ https://t.co/sOuhU8EcFj

@Peeverson So you wouldn‚Äôt be happy if they made it look like 3, but felt like 1?
@Peeverson Has there been any further details on the DkS 3 engine potential?
@OZARINtweets Yo üëã
@OZARINtweets I‚Äôm on the other side https://t.co/AE5E4lLha6
@YasuhiroKitao Any news on changes to Remaster beyond 60fps/4K/online improvements?
@SiggiGG Like the Lord of Sunlight
@straplocked @diescuminc I like to do a bit of both
PS4 could be cool
What platform are you getting the Dark Souls Remaster for? We should organise some jolly cooperation
What goals are you all looking to achieve in 2018?
@CCSpectre I got 3 portions left!
@VivaLaLazlow Sorted

@burner7711 @EpicNameBro Thanks! I‚Äôm interested to see how it pans out then. Praise it

@echosynthetic @DarkSoulsGame Yeah, that‚Äôs been available on PC already. I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôve overhauled the game visually as well. ü§ë
@echosynthetic @DarkSoulsGame I know!!! Max hype!! I wonder how visually different it will be
@Hi7ch Dark Souls is a masterpiece though. Shhhh
@Jigzaw_Killer Remaster for all platforms?
Awesome!! Dark Souls is coming to the Switch ü§ë
@RoeTaKa Heard it‚Äôs well optimised? Not sure if I could hit that with 970/i7
@straplocked The simple things are the best
@VivaLaLazlow Jack mind meld dough
@CAPCOMANIAC Got my gf a switch with Odyssey and Zelda, both of which are amazing. Completed odyssey in a few days
@NPZR Dayum, you lucky thang
What was the best thing you got for Christmas this year?
@RobHannah Is that the one in Venice?
@Sisslethecat Thanks, I‚Äôll check it out
Horizon is living up to the hype

@SkelOneS1 I liked the first a lot too.
@RetroBerner Binging is the way to do it üëç
@oceanicbones26 Ha, it was awesome! Nice cameo at the end there too
Wee bit of Res 1 on the projector üìΩ https://t.co/FADRJ8zFdO
@VivaLaLazlow Just got one, it‚Äôs worth it
@Hynaman @Jam_sponge Obviously struck a nerve there.
@Tapirodonte @Jam_sponge Agreed. I think playing Odyssey first was a mistake though as I miss those crazy high jumps, Link feels inept here
@Jam_sponge Just got both games. Find Odyssey much more fun to play, so far. BotW has felt a little unintuitive in‚Ä¶ https://t.co/IVc6YzjVja
