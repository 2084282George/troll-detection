What is it with men that spit into urinals as they urinate? What do they get out of it?
@therusstler @virginmedia It's even got numbers, very impressive

@MichaelHobson Checked with my Dutch friend last night, can confirm its existence
@MichaelHobson Umm I'm not sure, what is the phrase in Flemish?
Phrases I never thought I'd write in an academic essay: 'gargantuan condom'
Just spent about six hours proofreading the entirety of my German flatmate's 32,000 word thesis, I'm so incredibly generous.

May has gone into full-on broken robot mode with her answers to Qs. Sounds like  Ed Miliband in that terrible interview in 2014ish.
