Elbow, in Manchester, at The Ritz. It was absolutely brimming with "oi you spilled my drink" lads. https://t.co/HMKK4E32kQ

@CopyGirlHelen Haha, I understand, I don't think anyone I know who's watched it shares my opinion!
Was lucky enough to catch @FernBrady's Edinburgh work in progress last night. Definitely a must-see for anyone at the Fringe this year.
Tell you what lads, I picked quite the weekend to visit Hamburg.
I see Piers Morgan has deliberately pissed himself for attention again.
While you're enjoying your Bank Holiday spare a thought for poor Eva, who is undoubtedly tea-less at this very moment.
Lady Macbeth is a fantastic film. Very difficult to watch at times, but with great moments of humour sprinkled in.
Someone is clipping their fingernails on the bus üòê
Rare Saturday night in front of the TV. Ant and Dec. Changing the lyrics of Take That's new song's chorus to "pay your taxes Gary Barlow"
"A dynamic city like Manchester needs to fully embrace development, but" is basically the city's motto at this point.
What's the German word for dreading haircuts because you know as soon as you sit in the chair your ability to make small talk disappears?
The BBC, ever starved of primo Nigel Farage content, is now just reporting on the state of his marriage https://t.co/7ht8o3RxD9
Razorlight's "America" has just come on in the bar. They must be salivating at the royalties the next four years will bring.
Reading Inventing the Future and found a particularly relevant passage. Solidarity with everyone striking this week‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Ng4kNtp9Fb
@virginmedia Yes please!
@virginmedia Morning. Recently had to reset my Super Hub router, and now I can't access my work VPN. Any tips/how to guides that can help?
@virginmedia Nope - no known issues for my postcode

My #XFactor power rankings: 1. Relley C  2. Gifty  3. Saara  4. Honey G  5. Bratavia  6-11. Doesn't matter

@BrewDogShored What are the odds of you still having this in around 8pm?
Yerma was a bit special last night. Unflinching, devastating, brilliantly acted. Reckon it'll stay with me for quite some time.
@EFBarker Yeah, I barely remember the originals! New one was fun, jokes every 30 seconds, most of which landed. What's not to like?
Any bar that plays Mclusky will always have a place in my heart.
@JoBarrow Can't believe this happened a minute from my doorstep and this is the first I've heard of it üòü
