@coobanpete This was an arty wedding. The evening do was literally held in an art gallery.
@coobanpete I was pretty hurt, Racky. I have feelings* too.

This has been Miami Al, reporting from the gym. Back to you in the studio, Tom.
Shout out to the girl who practically sprinted to get past me to get to the chip-up/tricep dip station at the gym. Hope you tore something.
@ggeordiebore Mine are the bleakest moments of record store life.
Tyree’s superpower is definitely how many times he can rhyme his surname (Cooper) with the word ‘producer’. 🎶
Joined the mafia.
@dorkusmalorkus_ You nailed your manifesto to my front door.

If, uh, toddlers had *checks writing on back of hand* grenades we would all be safe.
@coobanpete Someone came into the shop and demanded I turn down the radio, turns out there’s no music here and I was singing!!

The internet has ruined me. I cannot #engage with their #brand in good faith. https://t.co/aPE5dDCAtb
@coobanpete Because I didn’t want him to phone back later pissed. Better off he waits a while and threatens kids in a chip shop later on.
@coobanpete *winces* Echo &amp; the Bunnymen Without Hats

@coobanpete GET OUT. LA Guns N Roses is the same principle.
@coobanpete Absolutely ballin’ today, Racky.
My sinuses have declared war on. Won’t be laughing when I punch myself in the face, the two bastard Judases.
@coobanpete He has never interacted with me. Luckily. Just Cuck Norris.
@coobanpete Why on earth would you get up at 4am?
@tyskiesour Oh jesus. Didn’t even see that. Wretched.

Ah, Valentine’s Day, the one day of the year I can finally admire myself in the mirror and wear an obscenely tight shirt.
@coobanpete I kicked you.
@commanderwhitby Already bought tix, aye.
@perrigame What wild boys.
@commanderwhitby Marked Men in Leeds. 28th July!
@coobanpete This is why I don’t have a proper job. Two ways - longest chain possible. And funniest mashup of two.
@coobanpete Exactly! I find it really addictive.
@coobanpete Cardiff’rent Strokes
@coobanpete It’s all collateral damage really. I fought yesterday so I’m still in “violence is the answer to everything” mode.

@bluebooksburner Poor man’s Argos.
@SecretMovesMMA Storm looks a bit like Namajunas there too.
@coobanpete At my gym if it’s your birthday, after sparring everyone gets in a line and gives you a round of body punches.
@ggeordiebore He’d just put a spice rub all over it. All I’ve ever seen him do.

@ellcol I’ll try Guide Dogs again like last year. I *need* to beat my brother’s time (and my own) despite the fact I think he’s lying.
