@bencrossley_ that made me sad. Can you not at least pretend they were terrible??
@han_morse @BethMelia in retrospect I do regret all the shouting
@BethMelia I gave it a good shot
@BethMelia don't even talk to me about it

@TehCurt Noo Curt, why you doing this? Was the first time you put this on not bad enough😭😂
@emilyyoutwit AHAHAHA I'm sooo jealous!
So psyched for all these bruises tomorrow.
@dtk91 your confusion was the best thing ever!
Should probably stop coming home and knocking on everyone's door to wake them up
@emilyyoutwit @zachbraff 10/10 for effort though
@emilyyoutwit well I understand now it's spelt. Mayo
@dtk91 sat in Trinity Kitchen listening to this gal. Don't act like you're cooler than me http://t.co/5hZM9dQItZ
@BethMelia alright?
Never been more happy to be home 💥
@amyyborowiak Happy Birthday!! I hope you have a fab time out tonight💜 xxx
@BethMelia not even going to defend myself with that one😂
What kind of weirdo tries to shut themselves inside a cardboard box @dtk91 http://t.co/mesJeuSTNE
@dtk91 prick.
“@SmileyBruno: Moist http://t.co/6aDraZ84TO” you're in love with me x
@handevine_ Thank you Han 💜💫
@beth_eds Thanks Beth 🎉💕xx
@han_morse Thanks Han!! Can't wait to see you, missing you way too much 💕xxxx
Too much information✋@geebizzl3 http://t.co/kmnemIMQKH
Witnessed a girl with her flat keys attached to her belly button piercing and now I'm not sure whether this uni thing is really for me
@han_morse 😭😭 aww thanks, can't wait for you to come!!
@BethMelia thanks so much! Gonna miss you so much, can't wait for you to come up and see me😘💜
@_amzee excellent effort, good try 👏 http://t.co/SkppDGKTpx
@dtk91 I owe you nothing. Your extortionate chips are still in a field in Leeds. Where you left them. After you threw them mid tantrum
@dtk91 I was looking everywhere for these yesterday! Couldn't remember the time or day though so it didn't go that well
@han_morse @Denni_Heppy @Amanda_TS13 @BethMelia I got nothing. No things
@BradLengden9 what! I can't believe how cheap you've managed to get it! I'm actually pretty gutted I didn't think of doing that
@han_morse Aw thanks Han! I'm not leaving you, I'll be back all the time to see you or if not I'm gonna be dragging you up there with me 💕💜
