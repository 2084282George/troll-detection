@LauraCoops19 try one from a proper coffee place and you'll enjoy it - totally diff taste
I always enjoy seeing sweet couples together. The best thing I overheard today was: "I hope the next bit of crack you take you choke on" 😍😍
@jadegellenseast have fun without me xoxoxo
@jadegellenseast this is why you should you to church and not amaretto 😂😂
@niranvinod @MissGallo @Everlane @voguemagazine but Niran, it's only good news for "Moms". Of course men can't enjoy fashion. 😒
The last 24 hours have been incredible. Grateful for all the people that are in my life.
@jadegellenseast why would you not just cook the rice? Water is free
Don't call something ineffective unless there is a plausible way to make it effective. #leadership
It's all a bit too 'modern gentleman' for me. Corduroy and Oxford shirts.
I can see him describing it as 'practical'.

The Transfiguration - the only decent way to confirm you're the Son of God imo
@jadegellenseast and my square head 😂😂😂
I have a great idea, let me find a flatshare on Gumtree.
Said no one. Ever.
People who stop directly on the other side of the ticket barrier are the worst kind of people.

@AndGloTweets elliot needs to get himself sorted out. Can't just keep running away from his problems
So Yazoo being just 50p in tesco was probably the best thing to happen today
I truly believe that the work of a leader is never done.
A sign reading "Giant Squid Farm arriving here" can only be a foreshadowing of very dramatic events.
I couldn't be more disappointed. http://t.co/61W9uo2QQh
Just entered the competition to win flight tickets to the homeland with @LondonCityAir #fingerscrossed #scotland
Of course I spend too much money on pretentious health drinks. I need SOMETHING to balance all the fried chicken.
Why did you do this to me Denmark? With your 18 kilometre long bridges and over priced coffee.
I STILL miss Denmark. It's been over a week now can I please just get over it.
@AskBankOfScot not particularly concerned as to the song, but after having been on hold for a total of 45 mins anything would be great
I guess they're just being thrifty/tight/Scottish
Even when it hurts like hell, I'll praise You

The baptism of Jesus (Mark chpt 1) is the most convincing argument for the #Trinity in my opinion
Giving a steady indication of what was to come

Worst thing about summer in London = tourists.
Best thing about summer in london = confused tourists.
'We hope to be on the move as soon as possible.' One of the most meaningless sentences ever?
@mrsbiffy injuries on both sides with protestors throwing objects. Not to mention petty vandalism....
'It's our right to protest' yeh go for it but see all those police they're costing taxpayer money and are unable to tend to emergencies
When the only bus that passes by is one not in service
They've now proceeded to call out to their classmates, Quinten and Hugo. You can't make this stuff up!
@oldmcduncan okay sounds like a good rule of thumb. I just want George to be happy is all
How often are you supposed to water a plant?
Very pleased with the overall result. Confident that @Conservatives are the correct party to lead the UK for the next five years.
And so the ballot count has begun
I'm proud to be part of a democracy and today #IVoted
I feel like I should write a buzzfeed post regarding my thought process
When people say 'quick question' it's almost certain to not be quick #leadership
