@hannah_mounsey @hannah_mounsey naw
People that use their phones on loudspeaker in public spaces are the worst people
@tompetty RIP 😢

@WeeRachey In the same position but just gotta be determined and disciplined.  You can do it!! Good luck 🤓🍀
#Sherlock Holy Shit.
When @ScotRail decide that two carriages is enough for the Edinburgh - Perth train at the start of rush hour, the week of xmas.#GreatIdeas
Yes please, midweek big cheese! 🧀🧀🧀 #Prow #excited
Fourth year is not the one...
So done with revision.  Still 5 days to go and I cannot wait for exams to be over!
@rchlhgh groupon have excellent Maldives deals for two just now... Nearly blue all money on a trip yesterday!
@rory_10195 sounds like finally someone might write a dissertation worth reading!
Unbelievable that even on a weekend of playing people's requests, @BBCR1 still ends up playing the same few naff chart songs on every show

Today is not a day to be stuck indoors :(
"It's well known that he who returns never left..."
To be properly British it should've been a scone recipe or tea-making instructions. Funny nonetheless! https://t.co/yFBHv90lj8

@rchlhgh I've never met a woman who can successfully achieve packing lightly...
Everything about Perth is less good than Edinburgh. Especially buses. Edinburgh buses are at least half warm inside! Pure freezing in Perth.
@WeeRachey
Why isn't it snowing yet!! Get it together scottish weather.  I want snow.
Halfway through 3rd year and finally lost my Union of Genius soup virginity
@leilawallace you are living the dream! Tuesdays are the best Hive days. Enjoy 🤘🏻
@19S73 mylo xyloto (not xylitol like my phone keeps trying to tell me) is a close second! All grand here! Hope all is well with you
In week 9 of the semester, how dan new people you've never seen before still be appearing in seminars!?
@PlainOldJamie Think you'll enjoy this: https://t.co/9jDXcB8Ezv
@hannahislost @WeeRachey it is worth watching, but they've gone for style over substance I think. The Aston Martin is 😍😍
@WeeRachey skyfall had a bit of plot though, spectre's plot was shite! And it's so cheesy... Bond isn't meant to fall in love! 😤
@LiamHarrier it's not a patch on the bear and the hare. That shit was emosh! 🐻🐰
I'm envious of how much common sense there is in the current Canadian government compared to ours.
Achievements of the day - going to beach, teaching my dog to dig on command, making it all the way to Oz #BigHole https://t.co/28X6cS4iwY
@rjackz asking all the big questions in life
#SPECTRE was pretty disappointing :(
Turns out I was wrong to think that mice wouldn't be able to make it up to the third floor...
@rjackz what dicks! Imagine eating curry on the train.
Tomorrow is my 11th day in a row at work.  Unsurprisingly I can't wait for my weekend off
Waking up in a panic because you dreamt you forgot the posters and flyers for the open day. #OICRecruitmentProblems
@PlainOldJamie maybe to should ask. It could be affect JCJ4eva
Twitter suggested I food Alex Salmond. What a joke!
That last tweet was exactly 140 characters. Definitely the second biggest achievement of the month!
Hasta la vista, The Maltings
Hahaha "3 episodes". Yes @Sherlock221B we're looking at you 😑 https://t.co/tvmm2fQoha
Nicked by half past ten? You're going places. Though probably not much further than the jail... #LoftThursdays
@laurenafterall some lessons can't be unlearned 😛
Not much is more disappointing than when you shove a handful of chocolate raisins into ur mouth and they turn out to be chocolate peanuts 😔
Im so bloody excited for this! https://t.co/Suy285lgzg
Ace evening with @jomack_ and Rhona🍷😊.  Perfect post-Sandhurst catch up
The bus I unsuccessfully caught just turned up 30 mins late. "Sorry I'm late, I hit a bush and smashed the windscreen" #FuckingStagecoach
Good night ruined by his slaughtering of the best song of all time. #sorryimlate #BBCGlasto #bohemianrhapsody
🙋🏼 I volunteer!
Not practical for speed bumps and potholes but still, looks pretty awesome https://t.co/1Hu4LXcmFP
Having just spent 10 days on the most wet and windswept place ever, it's nice to see the trend is continuing on our journey home...
The Rock is a shite film. But I've sat through two hours now so might as well see it to the end... How shit is Nicholas Cage though?
I fell into a hedge and now I'm stuck. If you could help me out that would b much appreciated. Thanks! -drunk Ryan
I'll free from exams!! Thank Christ. 🎉🍻

@PlainOldJamie I dont think it was so much money as maintenance of their own power &amp; influence. Though money was probably involved somewhere
I mean #SoberMeFTW (because i dont know)
@BBCR1 best fake smile - James bay an awesome song!
@rchlhgh there should be no shame in a swiftly indulgence session, only sheer guiltless pleasure 👍🏻
@rachelmargaret_ I thought managing three hours of revision without procrastinating was an achievement... You're winning at academic life!
Last night I dreamt that I was sunburnt and dehydrated. Even my subconscious knows how useless I am in the sun #BeingGingerIsNoFun
This.  http://t.co/NyMJnMNsuA
No one wants to have been up for 14 and a half hours by 7pm... 😴
@danniifalc just teasing! ❤️
@danniifalc you can't help but cause controversy can you 😛 #GetBackToWorkBitch 😉
@jomack_ good luck! I've only slept 3 hours in the last 48 so I'll be struggling with you. 😃😊😵😴
