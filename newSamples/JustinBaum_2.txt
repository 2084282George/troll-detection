@tomcrabtree nice! There is a Sonos showroom in SoHo and I spent some time I front of a pair of play:5s. Heavyweight.

@jacksonlatka @tomcrabtree I'd start with the new play:5s (PLENTY of bass) and then add the new 1s or 3s when they release to fill the space
@tomcrabtree A pair of Play:5s would be great for the space. Or Play:3s and a sub. OD-11s are gorgeous but lack the group friendly player.
@GambleLee That artwork is great, who's the artist?

@arlojamrog  Ha! Oh man, I was waiting for someone to catch that. Classic old guy "wheres my iTouch" move.
@RickWebb Ha. Dammit. I know. Hopefully W1 will be available for all mifi products eventually, not just Beats. (@AIAIAItweet)
@RickWebb The W1 chip is the big deal. First movement toward device/source agnostic audio for Apple products.
@dunstan @arlojamrog @hartsell Can I interest you guys in some smartwatches? https://t.co/yrqkXO7MKM
Everyone familiarized themselves with the Snapchat UI and Instagram was able to leverage that familiarity to compete.
V2 less about the specifics of content tactics and more about the science of how brands are effective. And bathtubs. https://t.co/f6R4Uaynyy
@higgis @alexrbarlow Gave me chills. Awesome shot and effort.
New York people - what ISP should I use in Manhattan? Preference is for smaller independent providers.
@elialtman We (wife and two cats) packing up and headed to Chinatown New York just in time for peak fish market heat.
This DOPPLR print is my favorite Web 2.0 relic. So bummed it didn't make it on the moving truck. Needs a good home.. https://t.co/hEyYfE9kEQ
You were not kidding. This set is fantastic Philip. Great mixes and deep vibez! https://t.co/HaZMxHyrLs
@CJN Yes, cheers @raspberryjones! Borderland: Transport was also the last vinyl I will buy from @othermusic. A good one to go out on. :'(

@AmericanAir Just called and the agent had not heard of SFO to JFK first class pet cabins, nor did his supervisor. How do I book them? Thx
@ryanchris Nice. Driver destinations will be great. Last week we did our second LA trip only using Uber. So much better than renting.

@frjpstweets Whomever did the packing screwed up, usually a third party. Happens to 1st time product companies, but this is product 2!
Yup, @frjpstweets I'm missing mounts too. I got two metal clips, not the plastic ones @narrativecare mentioned. https://t.co/a6GHhr5Npj

Whatever @GambleLee meant by going full zombie it produced one of the finest episodes yet. Aural couch lock inducing https://t.co/MAYJieMqrr
@feltron Congrats! It was really neat to see them yesterday and think back to the first time I encountered your work.
@higgis have you seen the wahoo Elemnt in the wild yet? It at least feels like it was designed this decade. Using their sensors too.
@2xlp @RickWebb Reasons not to use it - bad matching / accidentally removing original files and getting stuck with Apple's DRM'd files.
@RickWebb Deleting local files after matching them is NOT a feature. That's whats misleading about the article. Unless I am not getting it.
@RickWebb @2xlp "service design" lol levels of confusing https://t.co/78vrdjXEu1
@2xlp @RickWebb The unmatched stuff they don't have from old high school mixtapes to obscure releases is 100% stored and re-downloadable.
@2xlp @rickwebb When match first came out I UL‚Äôd my lib &amp; deleted everything local only to re-download it months later no prob.

@GiroSportDesign My matte black EMPIRE ACC shoes have some white casting from sunscreen. How do you recommend cleaning or conditioning them?
@buzz Wow. So real. Makes me want to reflect. Do you have a support group setup in NY I can join?
@0PN Take.It.Down. Long-game on a strong foundation of fans buying direct from u/label vs. Silicon Valley facade of streaming "audience".
@NTSlive Any chance there is a way to get the INT stream through Sonos or is it just the LDN stream that is available?
@hams happy birthday man! Moving to Manhattan in July (cc @pfeffunit) stoked to hang.
@CJN Damn all my fav stuff. Had one a day for a year while working at West.

@tomcrabtree thanks Tom. Yes, we are finally moving to Manhattan sometime between June and July!
@joshuatuscan Manhattan! Always loved it. Ready for a change after 12 years in SF. Will be consulting once settled. How about you?
@JosephPAlbanese A neighbor rented an identical unit for $6,250 last year. Looking for about the same. We approve on a per pup basis! #woof
@adjustafresh Hey Scott, our neighbor rented a similar unit in the building last year for over $6k. The square footage pushes it up there.
@wilsonminer @ryanchris Manhattan!
Our place in SF will be available for rent in June. 1850sqft three level 2bed 2.5bath loft/condo in the Mission. https://t.co/8yzyffGHGc
