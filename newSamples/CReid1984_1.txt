@Clairewhite111 @ColeraineFC I guess. I've seen Linfield twice once I was in the Glentoran end and the other time was in the crusaders end.
@Clairewhite111 @ColeraineFC Why not linfield?

How can America have public toilets that flush themselves when you stand up yet can't have cubicles with massive gaps where you can see in
@BestBuySupport we asked about price matching so we left our items at the check out and will be taking our custom to amazon
@BestBuy not happy at all with the service this evening in the Wilmington store
@Experian_US how do I cancel my account and get my $21 back?
@ScottMcGhie oh cool. You'd fit in here well buddy. Yeah I'm happy with the game but we have to face to falcons next who are looking good
@nommmmmi I am secretly hoping that she runs for president next time.
Think a serious investigation is needed to find out what happened to James forrests neck!! #naeneck #creepylooking
If it wasn't for @SportsDirectUK money grabbing from our club I'd be walking about with @Joey7Barton on my shirt. Kinda thankful in a way
@Avis thank you so much we got the car changed over and everyone is happy. You have gone above and beyond
@Avis we just keep getting attitude from the staff we speak to. I thought you would have pride in the vehicles that have your name on it
@sammy_robinson1 absolutely legendary mate. I worked with an old guy that had a full calf tattoo of bob Dylan
@ScottMcGhie I find your lack of beard disturbing
@piersmorgan @SirBroxiBear @chris_sutton73 I though Celtic were Irish not British. Make your mind up!!!
@ScottMcGhie that is far from ideal. Glad your ok though bud
@TraGearrFear @Joey7Barton go on then what does it mean
@nommmmmi peaky blinders is some show
@nommmmmi I like to watch it for the intense breathing face when they surface. Other than that it's a ridiculous sport.
@_naomimcgrath yeah we're doing good thanks. Wee dug is keeping us on our toes lol. Hope all is well with you too.
@_naomimcgrath yeah, a lot of their other stuff is great too. Check out knee deep and the wind by them. So good.

@SirBroxiBear Turkish media claiming it's a done deal.

@KnoxyDiane only in scholars would you get a hangover buster munchie box.
@_naomimcgrath what's the job?
@CaledonianAlum I require terms dates from September 12 - April 2015 for a security check for a new job. How is best to go about this?
@ScottMcGhie @bequietamy just watch a few games from last year and see who you like to watch.
@bequietamy @ScottMcGhie don't be swayed by Amy the bitter Bears fan. I'm a packers fan Scott. If I wasn't packers I'd be panthers
@redboxcare why did it not say that at the kiosk. Or why did the text message not advise
@ScottBot92 was it mains drive? And did you pass the medical screening (receptionist) before she would deal with you?
@melanieward19 lol yeah, now we need to find an easy way to poach eggs!! My method is very labor intensive
@melanieward19 how long does it take?
@bequietamy I'm picturing jones say Dubrovnik in his accent

@Applebees that takes me to the same page. Don't worry about it, we wasted our time last night I don't want to waste anymore of my weekend.
@Applebees do I need to call the number on the page?
@GBXANTHEMS can you give me a s/o listening to gbx in sunny southport North Carolina
I've learned a lot since becoming a forklift driver. One is if your not busy keep doing laps like your looking for someone/think #forklife
Just one game would be fine but naw!!!!
