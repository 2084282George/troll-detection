@voguenicky heres my theory ok see camels hold water for a long time like in their humps they can do that and you slept for a long time so
u think that I post like "this" but really I pos tlike "this"
I think I'm a good poster I've never had anything really happen to confirm this but I have a deep belief that I'm a good poster
a girl gave it to me on my birthday it was pretty cool
it's fun we're all having fun here
u might think that based on my pinned tweet and my 25tweet storm about a bob dylan song that I'm going to email you bob dylan songs
and it twists the song around now "I see nothing to be gained by any explanation" now what's he saying by this
about how you left me standing there crying üôÅ but now someone will be there for me and now your touch always means so much, presently
but you can't tell if it's because dylan isn't providing you with all the info or if it's just a weird sickness in the narrators
like in "if you see her" the singer jumps from "if you see her" to "if you kiss her" this weird presumption thing
"you left me standing in the doorway crying / blues wrapped around my head"
"and even if the flesh falls off my face / I know someone will be there to care / it always means so much / the softest touch"
so the line sort of cuts thru and it just hangs there and it's very sad and you don't know what the narrator is going to do with it
the whole verse is like a broken up stream of consciousness thing I guess like bits of internal monologue
"I been riding a midnight train / got ice water in my veins / I would be crazy if I took you back / it would violate every rule..."
that verse is particular is hard to parse it's sort of vague nonsense "maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't..."
