The Intimidating Stillness mix of @l_a_n_a_r_k's Touch Absence reminds me of Sweet Like Chocolate and that is NO BAD THING
@tunikas23 Ah yes that's right

@glorbis i thought polaris was legowelt? i love that record on bunker
@SMALL_RAVE @residentadvisor Thanks! Unfortunately I made that report for the company I was working for so it's not my IP to share, sorry :(
Ugh record shopping in Tokyo &lt;3
@MARTYN3024 @contakt321 and the whisper

as someone on discogs said, the whole thing could just as easily have been a perfect official remix
I'm sure I've posted this before but I still can't get it out of my head. When the reese comes in at 3:20 ‚Äì ughhh ‚Äì‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ilrAC4USsI
When you want and need to lose yourself in new music discoveries but won't have a halfway decent internet connection for another month argh

@aerielist Also sometimes Uniqlo/Muji is easier/quicker than laundry
@lighghtofficial man must have mad confidence in his own output if so haha
Actually you know what, if you keep putting out records like Paradox you can call your tracks whatever the heck you want &lt;3
Aleksi I love you but I gotta tell you about this thing called track titles
@rkssrkss @elmocrumb @vengaboys Me too now tbh, but between Vengaboys and blog house I feel like I've already picked my battle

@djhavingsex @ErisDrew your DJ name wins everything btw I approve
you probably don't need another person telling you how great @ErisDrew's RA mix is but
@Tonyhuk It's just cute! And no it sounds like the best club ever tbh
Dad (hi dad!) thought Blog House was a really awful club that I'd played in recently and wanted to know why it was so bad

@mikeservito @djvolvox I mean that was meant to be tongue-in-cheek but 172.5 is as fine a tempo as any, that much is true
@djvolvox what tempo were you playing at??

such a half-baked record tho in hindsight
@itspeach_ @JackBrolly lol be careful :(
Things were different back then lol. Not every teenager can grow up listening to Ben UFO you know

@MrJohnLoveless @Volte_Face_DJ @glorbis definitely the least bad of all the fidget house

@itspeach_ no thank god. only on some poached eggs. ruined my breakfast tho :(
@elmocrumb @joooehooowe not a bad result tbf
@SPFDJ @aerielist yessss
@aerielist honestly there are so many things wrong with the xone 92 that I'm now so used to that I forget I hated them in the first place ha
@aerielist oh, there's always the "press 2 cue buttons at the same time" trick too
@aerielist most of the range of that knob is in the last 10-20% though... you can get up to about 50/50 mix but the scaling is super weird
@MarcoZenker thanks for having me :))) had a blast!

@carlos_HghTght you can say that again
+ it feels like I made some real friends on this tour and that counts for a lot üíô
So thankful to everyone I played for (and to) in the US these past 2 weeks. Every time I go back I have an even better time than the last
Last stop on the tour tonight at Hot Mass in Pittsburgh. I know I should probably nap but I'm so excited arghhh
In other news playing in the USA is always so nice ‚Äì Seattle and NY shows were both wonderful and super friendly
@KishWidyaratna aw thanks! kasia got it for me ‚ù§

Freero recording i n c o m  i  n   g  - it's got a few cheesy moments but hey it was the end of the fest and, uh, that's just the way it is
@glorbis @olintechno @BenUFO @callsuper_ ... probably would accumulate a broader and deeper knowledge of recorded music than me (2)
Freeeeeeeeeeerooooooooo ‚ù§
tfw you just bought like 100 hours of music you're excited about and your next extended set in a small venue is 2+ months away
@glorbis @BlowUpWorkshop @olintechno btw maybe @callsuper_ would enjoy this thread
@glorbis on the upside, if blog house ever comes back around we'll def have the edge over anyone digging on Discogs haha
