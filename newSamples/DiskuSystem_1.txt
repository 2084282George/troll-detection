@L4NARK @RBMA When will this track get released though?
@ShockAndShaw A custom FPS cap for D2 on PC would be lovely. Look at the Overwatch settings for a guideline of what should be included.
@DeeJ_BNG Definitely not "Bungie. Net". It would be Discord but I don't raid nor play with a clan because of how haâ€¦ https://t.co/NySGmlkQCj
@emilyglassss My emotions~
@mossmouth Just call it an RPG, platformer or whatever with randomly generated level and permadeath.
@_icze4r Enjoying the article but please, add a proper scrollbar to your site that's not 1px wide. Makes navigation very difficult for me.
@Managore What they need is a way to look at results without voting.

.@0PN What are some of your favorite snacks?
@S0phieH I know people that downright refuse to commend enemy players even if the enemy were the MVPs. It says a lot about the person.
@mutedpsyborg I believe in you. We all do.
.@KevinSheaAdams @brooklynvegan I'm very sorry Mickey D's has fallen so much for you.
@emilyglassss Just send it to each label you like. That's why they got the email put up in the first place.
@Doshmanziari I've always found this album to be very good and have wanted a new album for a long time.
@EMILYGLASSSS Start a gofundme and post it on your tumblr. Surely people would help. Take care
@ISLANDjoints They're all followers.
@Doshmanziari I just read what you post, man

@juggalon9ne @VawxPopuleye @PlayStation Guys, the Heavy Rain remaster is not for you, it's for people that haven't played the game before.
@0PN Loved the final bit from Returnal. Fantastic performance. Thanks
@italicpig Is Cat Baptism playable somewhere?
@Doshmanziari My favorite anime.

@jeffgerstmann Wipe the power and eject button with a clean cloth. I heard it's dust messing with the touch buttons.

@chkkll What will this game be called?
@gameinformer Thanks for not including an image of the actual statue in this tweet so we're forced to click on the link. This is clickbait.
Will used maps carry over to the final game or will it all be wiped? @metanetsoftware
@sssmcgrath Looks like a mobile version of N++
@TheRealNickNerv Dude, you NEED to make a vlog about the day you got stuck in the lift and the events leading up to it and after.
Are you looking into balancing the final boss on Hard? I have to rely entirely on RNG health drops from the enemies to survive. @AxiomVerge
@Dashing_NYK Alright, thanks
@CreativeDojo @AdobeAE Oh, i did and it removed 55GB from my hard drive. Thank you~

@bradshoemaker Go to Xur. He's infront of the gate, in front of the entrance to the speaker. You can buy great stuff from him with coins.
I just backed Band Saga on @Kickstarter http://t.co/2CiUjm3DrV
@PlayStation There is nothing assuring about this statement. Quality over quantity, always. Areas not man-made will be lifeless and dull.
