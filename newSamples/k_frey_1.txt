@Drownedxo @AnthonyParasole Very little happens during the week here. I’d also highly suggest a skyline chili coma.

anyone shit for using a sync button when there's a BPM readout! Not sure what I'll do with all the extra time I'll save not dealing with

"Hot Cue" PLAYS automatically. Interesting how the word "play" isn't spelled with an h,o,t,c,u or e.  #cdjproblems
Apparently it's a NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE to reset a password for login to #pioneerdj #rekordbox #KUVO.
@mikeservito @Roland_US treat yourself Mr. Servito. It's just a different set of controls ;)
@golden_donna grabbed it last friday ;)
@midlandsound lol
@mikeservito can't stand it. Puts me to sleep.
@MATRiXXMAN I think I'd go for the SE-02 or Behringer model D over the SH01.
@TheBowieCat please list 420-friendly dating apps. Asking for a friend ;)
@glorbis @Keithefrey Great to see you Glenna! You're always such a breath of fresh air. I wish 1/2 the world had their head on as straight.

but you're a special kind of moron if you pay higher than the already inflated price for beats that aren't far off from the presets.
Detroit has some stinky weed.

The irony of the thurston moore comment for me is that noisier bands like sonic youth got me into techno. I'm sure I'm not alone.
@carlcraignet true. Always discovering.
@djempirical will be providing modular video. I'll be between him and the booth most of the night trainspotting.
I think I've finally recovered from Detroit Movement weekend, I mean Tangent gallery weekend. what'd that take 1, 2 days?
