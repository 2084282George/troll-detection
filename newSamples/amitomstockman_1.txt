what do you do with the inner conviction that you're a good poster in the face of a world that says you're a shitposter???
ok I'm done tweeting now
it's not all ukuleles either it's not even mostly ukuleles nobody nobody wants to hear that it's mostly guitars I guess I have a ukulele tho
that's not true probably illegal?? I just send songs of me and my friends playing like ukuleles n stuff but like bob dylan songs it's fun
before that would have been more sadguy bullshit basically but now you don't know if someone has entered the room
you can't tell if it's a narrative twist, or a pulling back, or if the narrator is just lost in his thoughts and just misspoke
here the weird twist in this verse starts with "I know someone will be there to care" - the entire song has been about loss to this point
like it is weird to assume that the person you're talking to is going to kiss this girl you're talking about
it's like sometimes dylan will give his singers these weird leaps of faith like they'll just say things that don't really follow
"I see nothing to be gained from any explanation / there's no words that need to be said"
also the last verse is weird "I eat when I'm hungry drink when I'm dry / live my life on the square"
"I would be crazy to take you back" is the climax of that monologue but the logic that brought you there isn't present in the verse
"you left me standing in the doorway crying / suffering like a fool"
"but not tonight and it won't be here / there are things I should say but I don't / the mercy of God must be near..."
the line "I would be crazy if I took you back / It would go up against every rule" is weird it just sort of hangs there in the song
