Slowly but surely I'll get back into this.

@_eeitak @rjackz That was the first thing I said too! Maybe it's because he's a clown through and through.
Furi is so fun, go buy it, go play it.

CRUMPETS ALWAYS GIVE ME HICCUPS
Waking up to ffxiv fanfest news is honestly like Christmas has come early. ❤❤❤

#NowPlaying Winter Morning I by Woodkid ♫ https://t.co/dZkfF8q8bz
Found my advent calendar halfway through December. Time for a FEAST.
@rjackz that is such a good brand name 💅
My black jeans finally ripped on the knee. That means they're cool now right?
@SoFairIsShe but have you actually hears the steam punk musical
What you have to do in life is get past the pineapple in the fruit basket. It's big, sharp and knobbly but there might be peaches underneath
@Siobhan_R16x SHE'S PERFECT
@fraser_cara So you asked them to do it then complain about it when they do?
Phallic imagery on phallic plants aside, the woods of Loch Lomond have been thoroughly stunning and peaceful.
OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME OHHHHH BOYYYYY https://t.co/xgxkFzWt3x
@DexterJManning @NintendoUK @zeldasymphony 😍😍😍 Yeaaaahhh!!!

Doing six hours of embroidery.... For FUN?? That sure doesn't seem right.

Holy shit https://t.co/HQ3tTSVUuL
Just played Pokemon X for the first time in forever. I have about 4 boxes full of Honedge from breeding and I nicknamed every single one.

@Jahel_N @DexterJManning :(
@Jahel_N @DexterJManning thanks I love me too
Making awkward eye contact with people on the top deck of another bus as you pull up alongside them. Hiya buddy 👀
Okami is one of the very very few games that brings me genuine joy. Replaying for the first time in years and I can't stop smiling. 🌸🌱
@MissMousieMouse Hope you're doing alright sweetpea&lt;3
One thing I don't like about living in a city is that I can't grow hundreds of sunflowers in my garden because I don't have a garden. :'(
Woke up absolutely craving the hell out of some BBQ sauce. Um... Okaaaaay
@MissMousieMouse zippers are always a pain! What a shame you'll have to make more dresses to practice 😉
@MissMousieMouse I LOVE THIS
When you're trying to play ffxiv with @dexterjmanning but you both get distracted with deeply rooted Beano vs Dandy war nostalgia.
Having a dance while making some late night dinner  💃 #NowPlaying Take My Time by Junior Senior ♫ https://t.co/VRFU7LMQuw
We couldn't tell if the glowing ghost dude was cheering us on or psyching us out or what. #sworcery
@MissMousieMouse I think I'm going to make it into an apron!
@MissMousieMouse I feel this on a cellular level.
@MissMousieMouse Have you got any photos?? :D
Went to bed kinda early but the wind kept me up all god damn night. What did I do yesterday to deserve this? 😩

@SoFairIsShe Maybe you're just well fit.
@rjackz Why do this to yourself :(
BOB ROSS IS ON NETFLIX
@MissMousieMouse Glad to hear you're feeling better sweetcheeks!
@Deliveroo You're such a tease. https://t.co/GtgS0G2XxA
The second you let thoughts of getting @Deliveroo take their hold there's no escape. Hovering over the checkout button praying for strength.
Yeahhh I'm feelin' this song.  https://t.co/asTPkdVfkJ via @YouTube
@SoFairIsShe The ultimate gift. https://t.co/xPphmYrK0p
@SoFairIsShe A pencil.
@Mipsyspindle Times like these I like to take a moment to think about how lucky I am to be where I am in the world.
I usually feel pretty disconnected from global news but recently it's been so real,  scary, all consuming and just plain saddening.
How have I only just found out that there's going to be a sequel to Kung Fury. I'm so stoked oh my good gracious me.
@MissMousieMouse @DexterJManning We miss you Mousie!&lt;3
@MissMousieMouse Then consider me scuppered :(
Auf wiedersehen Munich! Thank you for having us no matter how fleeting the visit ♡
That one chick who needs to tone it down with the eyebrow pencil. https://t.co/Jm5dUH5Pa9
Flight to Prague delayed by 4 hours. Woke up at 3:30am for no reason 😑
My biggest peeve about summer is that all shoes in shops needlessly become peep toes. So many gorgeous shoes ruined for no reason.
Sad, disappointed, frightened and immensely worried about what the future is going to hold.
"Have you been looking for a really, really, big stuffed frog?"

Yes. Yes I have.
