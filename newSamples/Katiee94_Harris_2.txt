@jen_mcgregor the awkward moment when you realise you actually have pulled a muscle by climbing up the boxes at airspace.
@iliza i agree with it's not a walk of shame. Let's change it though #StrideOfPride
Cat knows. Cat knows it wants out the door.
Pretty sure the woman upstairs just hit her cat. As I can hear literally everything at this time of night. Let it out and it won't run about
I'm that sleep deprived that I spelled nut as but.
@amyfent0n On my way! #jkSobAllYouLike
Dear Neighbour, I don't even care about the sex noises now. But the cats running about all night and all morning is doing my fucking but in.
@PatersonHamish RIGHT WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH ALL THE PORN LADIES LIKING THIS
Whoever the guy in letham is that kees beeping his fucking car horn every half hour or so, just stop please. It's my day off,I need sleep.
And my neighbour is getting banged for the third time this morning. Someone's having a great Saturday. #moaning #neighbour
@toni_sophia1317 eeesh what the hell is with that? üòïüò∑
Today i've hit a new low point in life. I ran out of spaghetti so am currently eating noodle bolognese instead.
My wifi doesn't work... So I'm reading a book instead of watching Netflix. #skybroadband broadening my wisdom since I got wifi. #disnaework
Finished watching the Get Down part one. I absolutely love it. So bloody good! Can't wait for next year #Netflix #thegetdown #bazluhrmann
@Abbilyy you can only sing it at work if you get drunk at work
I am not equipped to deal with nice guys.
Just watched an old man get called a "cunt" by a younger man who thought he'd hit his car with a trolley. The old man wasn't close.*
@jen_mcgregor @amyfent0n happily, she can come stay with me and bake me cookies
Actually might just give up on the group chat, no-one cares anyway
@PokemonGoApp nope keeps crashing
Not looking forward to work this morning ‚òπÔ∏èüò∑
So it's taken me a couple months of looking but I've lost a pair of red low-cut converse. If anyone finds them or has them let me know!
@kirstytlr @jen_mcgregor @amyfent0n the fact I had to tag you's after a solid half hour... #shameful #callyourselvesbestmates
@kirstytlr @amyfent0n my sister-in-law is the only other person I know (apart from you) that watches it.. I don't even watch it!!
@amyfent0n @kirstytlr ^ to the indirect not the academia bit
I feel like today has ended in the group going back through years old photos and taking the piss. #themoreembarrassingthebetter  #goteamgo
@jen_mcgregor FUCK!!
@Abbilyy get an American/Australian account for iTunes or android and the world is your pok√©ball
@mizpatts apparently the main guy has lost his phone
@ThatsSarcasm @amyfent0n @jen_mcgregor
Apparently I have shite self-confidence and my biggest weakness is that I'm not "results focused" . Remind me why I'm in sales again.
Well our pub quiz team was the tits!
