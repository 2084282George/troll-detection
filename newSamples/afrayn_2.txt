@lottelydia it is the best and I've neglected it for too long. Can't wait for the new stuff.
@shapirostephen in many ways, let's hope so.
@chrissievmierlo it is not quite, but almost a non-pology. Ugh.
Glad @marsden_sj also a right-thinking person on this issue. Probably need a new poll b/c incorrect options skewed result ;) @EnglishLitHist
Now we're getting to the important issues of the weekend. (cc @bronterre1 @RohanMaitzen) https://t.co/s4EVwvTZ3Y
@EnglishLitHist Ca-SAW-bon, obvs.
Good things done in one context aren't a shield against criticism in others, and I hope MB, who I admire in lots of ways, will listen.
This is a really excellent response to this weekend's Mary Beard twitterstorm, charitable and firm. https://t.co/jLweXUGGiu
@PlashingVole profoundly glad I didn't have Catholic schooling. I shouldn't now be amazed that people are that horrible, but I still am.
On a lighter note, this also cannot be retweeted enough. "Definitely, definitely, *definitely* not impotent." https://t.co/nYgJq9QiSa

Hopefully just slipped in under the wire with my abstract for @Orientation2018 on some new material - classic 11.59pm e-mail timestamp!
@RoryWaterman enjoyed the reading, and a pleasure to meet you - again somewhere soon, I hope!
Some very personal stuff from @RoryWaterman's first collection, &amp; some more expansive place-driven poetry from his new book Sarajevo Roses.
I've learnt today that if you need to make the last train, &amp; run over half the way, you can get from The Royal Dick to Waverley in 12 mins.
Amazing. https://t.co/uB6GunrjB1

What's an example in film of the classic 1940s/1950s photographer with a giant old-school flashbulb "caught in the act" motif?
@AndrewEpstein3 thank you so much!
Please can someone remind me what the (very early, I think) Ihab Hassan essay is where he plays with the parts of the word POSTmodernISM?
Don't recommend driving back from Edinburgh to Fife in a snowstorm, in case anyone was wondering.
@oldnorthroad You can only be good to students if you're well. Rest up, look after yourself (and don't give yourself a hard time).
