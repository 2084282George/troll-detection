Hats off to @Channel4 for keeping #GBBO the same, and yet doing it so very, very much better. The final was brilliantly done. üëèüé©üì¥

@laurenafterall That is quick! I'm yet to attempt a 10k, but I know Janet is keen.
@YouTube Hi. I need some help finding an old video of mine on youtube. Is someone able to assist me? Thanks.
@BBC_TopGear Clickbait! You missed '...the sale of new...' from your headline...
@BRWLTZ p.s. thanks for the running commentary, it's very much appreciated!

@GregorBanks @mick_k86 @realDonaldTrump Now that IS good news! I presume, then, he's just been pretending to be evil for a laugh :)

@wtf1official Hakkinen and Raikkonen! 'mon the Finns...
On #f1:
- I really hope that wasn't all Bottas has got.
- I hope Perez gets Kimi's seat next year.
- I hope Vettel wins the 2017 c-ship.
@ReutersTech Surely it's only a selfie if you take the picture yourself...? A lot of these just look like portraits.
@BrianRobertson8 so much pain in one tweet...
@mick_k86 @BrianRobertson8 I'm sad to say I wont see you both until Saturday evening. Looking forward to it though :)
@lfcgregw I don't know Moslem personally, but there's hope for him and the rest of Europe if they can keep it together.
@wtf1official that front wing is insane!
@SKODAUK never mind, I've just found it in the specs. Is it possible to order the SE wheels (Elbrus) on the SEL at no extra cost? Thanks.
@MadinahTamer @ReutersWorld the entire world does, and rightly so.
@POTUS time to unfollow :)
@Ness_Edinburgh her name is Janet Ross and the order is 100012584. It was 20506 that wasn't received.
@Ness_Edinburgh hi, sorry, the order is in my wife's name, it was a snood that was missing. Can I give you the order number?

@Tesco that's great - thanks very much for confirming :)

@EllieMae8471 thanks Lesley! She's very happy - the only problem is she's singing too loudly!!
@sammy_robinson1 personalised @marmite jars all round.
@Ryanair I still got the connection error message, but it went through eventually. Thanks.
@BrianRobertson8 @AmeliaSofia @GoPro there's always Glenshee ski resort about 40 mins drive from us... :)
@BrianRobertson8 @AmeliaSofia @GoPro brilliant! We've got to think up some good adventures then :)

Baby iguanas vs. racer snakes is by far the best movie I've seen this year. #planetearth2
@McLarenF1 whose body is he wearing in that first picture?!? Happy birthday! Please resign.
@JamesClarkson96 Some things are important to talk about, JimBob. I reckon Trump and Brexit are so bad, they fall into that category :)
Fred may or may not have just had his first taste of chocolate while Mummy was upstairs getting changed there. #hewolfeditdown
@andrewbensonf1 @BBCSport yes please! Although seen as new bosses seem to be in Rupert Murdoch's pocket, I'm not hopeful of good change.
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise[!]
@itvnews @TeamGB who's idea was it to have someone hold a massive flag at the front of a group photo? They're the one short on braincells.

@VisionAfrica @GlobalGiving done!
@BrianRobertson8 is the pope a catholic?
@BrianRobertson8 I think it'd be a pretty good match. One day a supercomputer will be able to tell us for certain and let us watch it :)
I'd like to see on-form Sampras play on-form Federer. Who'd win? Federer seems like an easy answer, but Pete was mighty.

@GrandPrixDiary I reckon all the 8s and -8s cancel each other out so it's more likely that the mapping is changing its mind...
@Mobilescouk Hello. Sim Only section on your site doesn't work very well: filters don't work properly and impossible to see all tariffs.
@GrandPrixDiary F1 quali: what would be wrong with scrapping quali after first race and simply running by c'ship points in reverse order?
