Amazing work from @Junction25 @PlatformGlasgow  tonight. Well done all!! ❤️ x
If anyone has negrophobia tickets let me know. I reeeeeally would love to see it!
@LeylaJosephine1 I get the party vibe now. Noted, I'll bring snacks.
@LeylaJosephine1 but this party sounds great- I'm all for it!!
@LeylaJosephine1 hahah the day I realised I'd found my musical soulmate!
@ritualandothers @GudrunSoley @CPPGlasgow we can put it into the review at the end of the festival!
@fkalexander is the best person in the world
@GudrunSoley y no cats on this
My 8 year old cousin got mistaken for my child today and it's made me quite unsettled.
Writing blogs and deliberately not peeing because I need a sense of urgency in my life to make me do anything, working a treat 👏🏻👌🏻
IT WAS JETLAG!!!!! https://t.co/JukNciej2F
@jennifer_maie you're on Australia time 😊😊😊
Fell onto a flooded walkway, soaked one side...Walked it off like a pro then a lorry drove past me getting the other side. AUSTRALIA HURRY!
I feel like @jennifer_maie needs to come to my house every morning and do my make up for me.
Noooo Uber driver you may not join me in push it tonight.
We realised in the SELKIE rehearsals it's been a year since we did it the first time. WHERE HAS THE TIME GONE?! @Craaaigeth @jennifer_maie
What. A. Day.
Just seen the actual SPIT of honey G in a Range Rover on Byres road.
I am frequently having dreams where I am driving despite not having licence. The police always drive past me, and I always get away with it.
Discovered black mirror. No going back.
@fkalexander I think it's for EVERYONE but I appreciate the sentiment 😊😊
@jennifer_maie I swear I didn't notice!!
Watching the Amanda Knox documentary and the man from the daily mail is giving me the absolute boke.
The last thing in the world I want when I'm hungover is to watch scary films and yet here we are.
So jealous of the night @LeylaJosephine1 is having right now.
Woooooohooooooo!! Xmas and new year in Oz is booked! Bring on the sunshine and FINALLY being back with big sis!
@dan___cox stupidly thought you were going to offer me a solution. Constantly underestimating your capacity to be mean.
How are we still protesting a women's right to choose?!? What the fuck is wrong with the world!!!!
@mcmaster_peter yes! Well wish me luck 😫💁🏻
@mcmaster_peter oh it's bad. The hangover fear is very real.
@jennifer_maie @asiafaefacebook could of been a disaster. Avoided like a pro 👌🏻
Keep having dreams I'm driving a really fast car even though I don't have my licence. I'm always terrified but also totally buzzing.
@GudrunSoley @Pricksterrr stop.
This is how I die
Actually not sure how to face another night out 😫😫😫
"It's a shame because all the tress will go and all of Brazil will die, I'm just glad it won't kill the UK" 12 year old on climate change.
Sitting on my sofa a hungover shambles eating Pom-bears and drinking irn-bru. Tequila is never worth it.
@anknaarockiam me ^^
@anknaarockiam only just following me.... Rude.
@jennifer_maie always ^
@jennifer_maie a rose by any other name is still a fat mouse.
@jennifer_maie you're fascination with rodents freaks me out.
@ChrisCjoc dammit. Caught on camera AGAIN.
@GudrunSoley mate. She didn't seem keen at the time though, don't take it personally 😊
@ChrisCjoc haha could be worse... I could be about to tackle ITN 😂😜
@jennifer_maie 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@fairlie_caitlin she should do what the fuck she wants. I just get a fright when I put my bins out.
Waiting for a taxi to celebrate @jennifer_maie birthday. Tiki cocktails are a waitin.
@GudrunSoley so like Pocahontas isn't the same. They sing about monkeys and holding hands. That's not in version I know.
Spending so much time with an Icelandic person @GudrunSoley makes me realise how little I know about translation
For someone who got 9 hours sleep. I'm rough.
A spider the size of my hand just crawled over the arm of my sofa.
@anknaarockiam nothing on Coldplay but yeah ...
@dan___cox  niiiiiight!!!! https://t.co/zHMhC8TRHb
@dan___cox you know it! 😫😫😫
@dan___cox I'll download it drunk one night. Guaranteed!
@dan___cox guess you should then...
@dan___cox destroys the soul.
@WillStringr @jennifer_maie we were right in front of radio 1 stage so saw loads but I wasn't a massive fan of the line up. Haha yaaaas!!
@WillStringr @jennifer_maie next time I want an invite and we can just not talk to each other but eat soufflé in silence instead.
After having spent three days working and sleeping 3 hours a night I've spend all day napping and there's no way I'll sleep tonight!
@jennifer_maie 😂😂😂😂
Dominoes ordered.
This is so real today https://t.co/XTp5S6YTJR
Aaahh Scotland voting completely differently from England?? Shock.
My need to own a cat grows daily.
@GudrunSoley you are an awful human.
@GudrunSoley now I've stopped. And I'm dissatisfied with everything. They are wrong!
@lornamcmillan96 yaaaaaaaasss!! Who said ICP was shite???!
Showering all the milk and chandler floor away 👌🏻
Can't believe SELKIE is all done again. What a weekend 😊❤️ @Craaaigeth @jennifer_maie
Uni has got me so stressed
My mum is literally always late.
Still thinking about privilege last night... Seriously brilliant work👌🏻 @PlatformGlasgow
@jennifer_maie such excitement 😂😂
That time I legit looked like a camel in a club 😂 I'd hate @jennifer_maie if it wasn't so funny!  https://t.co/6KGw8NkVal
@GudrunSoley ooh
Pizza pizza pizza!!!
