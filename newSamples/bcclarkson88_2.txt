@jacko200118 @Bethmackinnon7 Same jacküòÇsame
@Bethmackinnon7 @charpatterson_ Winston should feature too
Last night my 6 year old cousin asked me if I was gonna have a special dinner on Valentine‚Äôs Day, and I answered ‚ÄúYeah! I‚Äôm havin Dominos!‚Äù
@kathryntatlowx @Bethmackinnon7 Get a room
@weloveSTR That‚Äôs what you get for updating snapchat
@kathryntatlowx To be fair Joseph and I frequently have conversations about geometry and they‚Äôre quite in depth
Tonight Aaron Ramsey has become a serial killer. Just a question of who he‚Äôs killed this time
@sophieKsunberg Much better thank yo
No more prelims ever again!
@Bethmackinnon7 ‚ÄúGoing‚Äù
@kathryntatlowx So your playlist works then. Well done!
@Bethmackinnon7 I have a feeling I‚Äôm not in the same category as @bequietamy but I‚Äôm not in a bad category
Here‚Äôs an example of @Bethmackinnon7 asking a question everyone else in the world has known the answer to for absol‚Ä¶ https://t.co/yHvpmuJubk

Sitting in a car with people that can actually sing is annoying cause you‚Äôre the one that can‚Äôt and you feel you‚Äôre ruining the song
Why is it always when I need to wake up early that I have he biggest struggle to get to sleep?
@charpatterson_ Hmmmm
@charpatterson_ *bonnie
@kathryntatlowx Awh yeah I do that, but mainly cause it‚Äôs hot
@yellalongbottom @kathryntatlowx Someone‚Äôs a gif wizard
@kathryntatlowx @yellalongbottom I feel like I defos am getting away with it cause I am entitled to an opinion
@jacko200118 I give full commitment! For a portion of the time! Is basically what you said. It‚Äôs all or nothing, I choose nothing
@jacko200118 Oh where oh where oh where oh where oh where...is my hairbrush!
@jacko200118 Defos tops your Star Wars plasters
Love that #snapchatdown is the second top trending topic on twitter right now
Most interesting thing about Snapchat being down is seeing people use other form of communication to express how they‚Äôre slowly going insane
@kathryntatlowx Not my fault your facts are wrong
@kathryntatlowx I mean I saw @stoptherainuk tonight and you didn‚Äôt so I win
@jacko200118 I‚Äôll be waiting for updates
@jacko200118 I‚Äôd miss you too much üòò
@kathryntatlowx @Bethmackinnon7 Nah I‚Äôm good
@kathryntatlowx @Bethmackinnon7 Beth you crack me up
@kathryntatlowx @Bethmackinnon7 List?
@Bethmackinnon7 @kathryntatlowx I was gonna say you‚Äôre flattering yourself but that‚Äôs a pretty fair statement to make Beth
You know winter is on its way when you have to have lights on before half 2
You know either Rangers or Celtic are playing at McDiarmid Park when all cars in Perth are stuck in traffic
@kathryntatlowx @Bethmackinnon7 If it helps I used to think that...
But then I turned 7
@Bethmackinnon7 @kylefummey I‚Äôm not from Perth tho
Scotland‚Äôs qualifying campaigns are starting to look like the SFA decided to conduct a social experiment on 5 million people
When @stoptherainuk forgot encores exist https://t.co/FIv2w3ETmE
@stoptherainuk I just got my hearing back. Thanks. Great job!
Love Thursdays so much. Day starts at 11 and it's PE then have two classes either side of lunch and day is over at 2:45
Guess who's back, back again. Zlatan's back, tell a friend #Zlat10
@leximable Nobody likes you
So the current problem I have is that my bedroom is too warm with the window closed, but I get woken up by the neighbour's dog if it's open
@kylefummey @sam_flood_ @JamesClarkson96 @stoptherainuk @Ben_muiir I wanted to vote for Chris but he wasn't in the poll
Honestly being able to hear out of both ears is so underrated
@Unco0rdinated Good thing I was speaking hypothetically
@Joe_Gatto Is he legitimate?

Very good filling July with retired footballers playing internationally in a 6 a side tournament from now til Sunday
Just came back from a run to find 2 missed calls from my dad because i didn't tell them where I was. Then I call him and HE doesn't answer!!
@beth_anna123 @JosephTatlow Well I'm not gonna follow Sturgeon
@beth_anna123 @charpatterson_ But the United Kingdom is the country those countries are all in Beth is what I've said to you all day
@beth_anna123 Yeah but your primary must have been rubbish if you don't know what country you're in
@beth_anna123 I just don't understand how you've gone 15 years without realising this
@leximable "And it breaks God's heart"
@leximable "They're never connected"
@amyswan998 You been coping well?
@sophieKsunberg @leximable @richardshockey @JoyfulJenny16 Sophia is just turning the whole world yellow one step at a time #yellowfever
@leximable I'd like to see what nicknames they have in that group chat
May I have your attention please. Will the 42nd GS please stand up? I repeat, will the real 42nd GS please stand up?! #GenAss2017 #GA2017
@NazareneScene There's now 8 of them
@NazareneScene Does someone here have the job of 'big balls light colour changer'
@leximable What are you all mourning?
I'm realising that we repeat lines of every song, unaccompanied by music. Do the singers on stage not like the instruments? #genass17
@amyswan998 Guess you're gonna have to wait like 7 forevers then
@amyswan998 I've barely been here yet
@amyswan998 Thankfully
@beth_anna123 @HannahClarkson8 Bit late for that
@beth_anna123 @HannahClarkson8 Get a room
