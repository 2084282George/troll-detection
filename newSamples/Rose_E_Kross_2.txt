“I know that dress is karma. Perfume regret” had to look it up to check if that’s what I heard.
@teachu2die And: the healing powers of chicken tacos
@UMFANG Did I see you sing that once? I have a faint memory!
@Webstarr_ I have never seen a bag of crisps and I was confused at first what they were. Lol. They seem next level!
Now everyone’s gonna be “Zombie”ing it up at karaoke. But I know the brave souls singing “Linger” will steal the show.
@UMFANG Yes! https://t.co/UaMvFuTJnX

@beckadiamond Dope
@wystandoll I didn’t want to know tbh.
I honestly don’t think I can watch Hollywood movies ever again. Or maybe any new movie.
It’s insulting to an artist’s practice/process to demand they play a game to enhance visibility that leads to “bookability”
@Joey2lanes @aerielist Joey...it’s not JUST those two. Not what I was getting at. But yeah, a discussion is clearly… https://t.co/W4TmDOdC02

@oscarmulero @berghain Wish I could be there...😢
I’m sorry...I brought my home made kale salad along with me.
Hope to do something a little different that you might like tonight... https://t.co/caVC2IL0uQ
