Not about waiting a year for Naby tho.
Liverpool doing bits in the transfer market, a month til we go Japan and drinking by the river in August sun. Not a bad Bank Holiday Monday.

@rhythmpanther_ Yeah it's madness, sell Phil on the last week before a season and replace him with someone shite. W‚Ä¶ https://t.co/XkP75ZQy3f
Mad this, football season starts today and all anyone is arsed about it is transfers and that. I'm sure people miss the entire point. #LFC
@chr1spbacon Didn't know you were a Bolton fan mate!
@ShitChester something has majorly gone off in town, all emergency services going round to York Street behind Tesco!
@FootyAccums had a 5 team BTTS with Oldham/Burton to draw and cashed out! https://t.co/EhBuQM7eVU
Praying that Plymouth get a consolation goal. @Only1Argyle should fetch me ¬£620. Only 1 Argyle indeed.
@AntonyThePony Agreed! Defo up there with Battle of the bastards and Hardhome; my favourites before last night.
Fucking hell #GoT was tense this week.

@RorsDM Yeah the Pride &amp; Joy one is ace!
@RorsDM Interesting! I'll give it a go. Just been rinsing Tesco's 3 for ¬£5, they're stocking some decent stuff these days
Spent the morning thinking it was Friday. https://t.co/5eQ0tfE0d8
Some #lfc love a bit of meltdown. If we get VVD and Naby the club'll announce it. Stop worrying cos Brian from The Blob says it won't happen

@andrew_marsh Haha, i'll only have to wait a few days too!
@OliverBerisford Spot on that, they don't make me feel anything, except boredom
Good watching Radiohead on tele cos at least when I fall asleep it'll be on the sofa and not in a field.

@LFCroundup Think you posted the wrong photo, this is just a lake
@carl_lfc_1892 @TheAnfieldWrap Be alright once they're in red anyway fella
If #Salah has chosen number 9 then I hope he's better than our last few. Still nobody has had the balls to take the number 8 shirt #LFC

Fucking hell, making Corbyn deny he's a terrorist sympathiser and in the next breath asking why he won't nuke the world. #bbcqt
@andrew_marsh Can't believe how long they spent talking about wanting to nuke people. Fortunately that woman spoke sense to end it.
When the CB and the LB are drinking in the same pub #squad https://t.co/YRT5LXFHzJ
What's the story? (Don't vote Tory)
@carl_lfc_1892 Haha yeah there is on the other side tbf.
