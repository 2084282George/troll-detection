I love the deluded weather optimism of recreational golfers. I’ve seen two in shorts today and it’s 45 degrees out.
You don’t need to react to or respond to the troll in the WH. And at the very least you can do it without retweeting him.

@NedRaggett Good point, definitely.
Always weird to look at this stuff after the fact, but it was kind of an empty calm before the No Fun storm of the early 00's...

@judyberman @Steven_Hyden @dmandl I blame the open-auction submission things in part. I'm glad they stopped those.
@Steven_Hyden @judyberman @dmandl I think they stopped for a while &amp; now do them on a case by case basis.
@JJStannard Felt the same, though I got really tired of this one as it went on. Loved the 1st 2 tho and happy to see the “series” continue.
@judyberman oh haha i missed that in your tweet. whoops! sorry.
That actually does make me feel better, thanks! https://t.co/WEdJBNsel5
