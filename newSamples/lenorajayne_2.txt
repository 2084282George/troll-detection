Might move to Berlin solely because I can get cheap tahini, the best fresh lavash and rose jam at the Turkish markets here, omg.
Keep getting emotional thinking about how I'll be back in Berlin in 48 hours. 
Will be good to be (second)home.
@glorbis The best is when you're on Facebook and start typing "Facebook" into the URL bar ...

@jessielochrie I prefer to think of it as becoming a cyborg, but ya, I have an appointment for that this week too 😩
@jessielochrie but we're so underground maaaaaaaan
@remixdevice Slightly terrifying but definitely still masochistic enough to try it 👹
@remixdevice This sounds like my idea of euphoria tbqh 💯🌶
She asks me if I'm vegan and laugh and say "Yep, I've just recently come to the dark side" and she high fives me
