@SeanBattySTV What's the weather going to be like in Millport this afternoon Sean?
Oh shit wrong band.
I think this is the worst scene of GoT that I've ever seen.
Ahahahahaahahahahahahahah Ed Sheeran ahahaahahahahahahabagavavavaahahaaha
I think Jaime's forgotten how to do an English accent. He's sounded Danish as fuck all episode.
What are House Stark's words now that Winter has actually come. It can't exactly be "Winter is Here" can it.
DROPPED
READ THE BOOKS PLEB NORMIE SCUM REEEEEE
Speaking of once-great TV shows, it's time to watch GoT I reckon. I can't remember what happened last year. There was an explosion I think.
Getting excited with my phone vibrating in my pocket then seeing it's just a low battery warning.  

That's life.
@_clump Sick. Freddos on you.
@_clump How much do you personally get if I listen to a song? 0.000001p?
Every, repeat, every, French town has one. Get there and get to the pub. Sorted.
I love beer so much.
Remember that time I played Doune the Rabbit Hole with Imprint and got to a drum solo where I decided to drop a stick instead. @_clump
'Put the cart before the horse' is translated by 'put the plough before the bull'.

Since when do bulls drive ploug… https://t.co/23sOfqHhtK
But then again to kick the bucket makes no literal sense either. I love idioms man. Where do they even come from.
Yeah Uncle Jeff died last week. Finally broke his pipe aged 87.
Just got a wee pocketbook about English/French idioms. Finding the French translations makes you realise how bizarre they all are.
Barman here gives me dirty looks because I go up to the bar to buy a pint instead of waiting 10 minutes for him at my table outside. Connard
Fucked it. #SCOENG
Trump hasn't yet tweeted even once about the shitshow that is British politics at the moment. Does the man even know about our election?
Good to see that loony identity politics seem to exist only in their online echo chambers. Real people don't care.… https://t.co/rxHSAyZnzy

Sturgeon was nowhere to be seen. I was introduced to the Green party leader too but fuck knows who that is.
Had a dream last night that I was in a flat at a post election party. Corbyn was sad and May was pregnant. I had to kiss her on the cheek.
@liamTK Then again Twitter is a massive lefty echo chamber. If any of my mates voted Tory they were bloody quiet about it.
@liamTK Ken, but the exit polls are showing a 99% chance of a Conservative victory there. Fuck knows how that happened.
Am I seeing this right? Is it just me or is the exit poll showing a Tory win in Perth?

Ahahahah what the fuck. Nuke it now.
I was hoping for a bloke in a wheelchair at the end but nope. Wasted opportunity. https://t.co/i1d3S4l7ql
Is it too late to register to vote lads?
September's a long way off, I might not even be alive then. Then how'd you feel. What'd happen to your hours then?
Making them repeat shit as I don't have the vocab for such dull conversations. Gets embarrassing when I don't know the word for spreadsheet.
Just off a 20 minute phone call with the admins at my uni trying to sort out the hours for next year. Absolutely horrible ordeal man.

Fucking fly swarming around my room, thinks he's got me trapped. 

Nah mate. You're trapped here with me. https://t.co/ca4GoEBgsm
Mind iTunes? I don't. Spotify all the way.
Like a glamourous return to The Joshua Tree and away from all that Elevation shit.
French @DaftLimmy getting lifted at la gare. Elle avait tourné les gamins contre lui. https://t.co/cSPCcFRAjm
Last class done. Just a couple of exams to sit through and then I'm free 'til September baby.
Not because of how great he is but because they don't like Le Pen. Feels a bit hollow.
Nobody even knew who Macron was a week ago. It's good Le Pen didn't get in but it's a shame the guy that actually won is so dull.
Poste can either be LE poste (a post office) or LA poste (a job post). Awfully confusing.
I've had a bottle of Gewurztraminer to myself tonight. Not even leaving the flat. The wine is just that good.
Due to 2 weeks of Easter Holidays and some classes starting internships, I only have 5 classes in April. I'm working 10 hours this month...
@travelingwolf_ Let's go to the pub.
I have rediscovered hot chocolate.
Scotland is the worst country in the world.
They just told me this afternoon. Fuck my plans for that class, I've got to waste my evening writing exams for a class I've just inherited.
Scotland's year la
Applied for a job in Barcelona the other day, they just emailed me asking if I can come in for an interview on Monday. That might not work.
@letsthinktwice hahaha. Where's that?
Sitting in the staff room looking annoyed. If you look annoyed then people think you're busy.
Hands free. https://t.co/YQjfUfVUPU

Millennials were a mistake.
Did a mock election with my students today. One of these party names is not like the others... https://t.co/Qf9HkBRQ2K
Bringing kids to protests is weird, I don't care which side you're on.
The students know about my Tinder faux-pas. One of them made a very snide crack about it earlier..
Apparently for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (or petition).

https://t.co/MagDLcyaYI
You just know she's messaging literally everyone else in the class about it too.
Finally paid the price for mindless right-swiping on Tinder. Matched with one of my fucking students.
