@BrianRobertson8 I like the one from before the Incursions- simple, practical. Everything a fashionable superhero needs.
@BrianRobertson8 you're ahead of me! All I know is that out of the two Captains America they can't come up with one good costume!

@BrianRobertson8 which is alright for a wee change of pace, but I'm a sucker for the big world-shaking storylines.
@BrianRobertson8 worth it.
Since #binda16 is over, looks like it's time to delete Twitter for another year. See you at bida17!
Was that @Littlejoshy678's son on the Millbrook video? #binda16
Why is the DS sitting in Stephen Wallace's seat? #binda16
@BcclarksonBen get a grown up pastor to do it.
Cacophony. Triple word score. #binda16

@Phil_Hoy1 only in my dreams! The Internet is abuzz- I just hope Sinister's in it!
@Unco0rdinated you've got gossip? I would do anything to hear it!
@mick_k86 just read this for the first time in years- "The only reason we don't have revival is because we are willing to live without it."
@mick_k86 I'm a bit offended that you think I need the help...
@carly_maxwell13 ........I'd give it a 6. Good, but not great.
@mick_k86 I'm no expert, but that's high quality parenting right there. Honestly, two of those I didn't know!
@JamesClarkson96 no such thing, my man! Just have to use holidays like normal people.
@JamesClarkson96 hey pal, I'm not bad thanks! How are you doing?
@sammy_robinson1 always nice to see a friendly face in the audience- shame it was yours....
@JohnLindamcm hi guys! Any chance John's email has been hacked? Got a strange email from you today!
@sammy_robinson1 @mick_k86 irrelevant. +10 internets to me.
@mick_k86 http://t.co/VmZl74SPkQ via @youtube
@19rach08 do it! All day!
@sammy_robinson1 bless your heart, man- you even put the hyphen in the same place I did!
@neverner1990 this one. http://t.co/LuZyQ7ulKD
Bye Watermill! You've been distinctly....adequate. #NazDA13
@JamesClarkson96 no, better give him a break- he's old and tired!
@JamesClarkson96 sure did- don't think I've ever got a note in the Assembly before! #NazDA13
"Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me, let me be singing when the evening comes." #NazDA13
@Unco0rdinated it's cos I'm awesome.
@JamesClarkson96 genuinely laughed out loud at this!
@JamesClarkson96 that's only because I'm so awesome!
Christian marriages- don't settle for old wine, because Jesus wants to give you the best stuff #nazDA13
No reserves, no retreats. #NazDA13
@ptrjhntrrnt copyright. If Jesus hasn't come back by then, NYUK will have to pay my descendants millions of Future Pounds.
#NazDA13 #nyuk2013 what happened to the profit from the cramlington mission? Get Sammy to empty his pockets.
#nyuk2013 #NazDA13 is it true that every president gets one free kill?
#nyuk2013 isn't he too old to be at this convention? #NazDA13
#NazDA13 second breakfast! http://t.co/a5tHN1shkY
@19rach08 @WilliamR90  it was disgusting, they were all over each other- I just thought you should hear it from me.
@mick_k86 is that sweetcorn? #NazDA13
@mick_k86 @phil_hoy1 you're just jealous because mutant mercenaries hardly ever retweet you.
@Phil_Hoy1 @lifeasdeadpoolx in the words of @qquire, remember when Wolverine used to be cool? Me neither.
@The_Sandizzle @mick_k86 @BrianRobertson8 I see your video, and raise you one video  http://t.co/ye2Wv1xD
@JohnLindamcm glad they're being of benefit to someone! Tell him to excuse the grammatical mistakes- they've improved over time!
@JohnLindamcm @sammy_robinson1 the secret's out!
@sammy_robinson1 that depend very much on the theme- if it's what I'm thinking you wouldn't be winning any prizes!
Just sent out the NYI Update- let me know know if you want to stay in touch with our youth ministry
@joel_mcilroy18 glad I'm not the only one who censors this song!
@sammy_robinson1 "lead use"? Me fail English? That's unpossible.
@britishmonarchy hi, we're a Church youth group and we just wanted to say that we're big fans of the royal family and all that you do!
@itvjeremykyle hi, I'm sat beside Jack and Tom, and they're really excited to get in touch. Can you do some kind of DNA test on them?
@elliegoulding hi, we're a Church youth group, and the guys wanted to say that they love you loads. Would you like to come visit us?
@mick_k86 any time I get one I look for you inside and say, "Why don't they Mick the McFlurrys anymore?"
@tanita2507 thanks Tanya! The youth did so well. It's always helpful to be a big kid!
@chels_annie Just realised I've been following a girl called Chelsea Kane, but she's not you, on the grounds that you're not married to Mick
That awkward moment when you're not wearing a belt and the airport security guy frisks you. #NazDA12
@Phil_Hoy1 Thanks pal- I hope everyone else enjoyed it as much as I did! The homecoming gig is always tough. You were great on the guitar!
@sammy_robinson1 I'm no expert, but I think you've been using it wrong!
Uh oh- just made my very first tweet and now Twitter appears to be broken. A new record, even for me. Sorry everyone.
