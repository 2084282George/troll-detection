@Greta_Cottage @ceeeeeebs mussels :(
@FinnJohannsen Tearing Up The Album Charts is perfect in every way, and dare I say it better than some of Felt‚Äôs records.
@TectonicPinch @subloaded @TrinityBristol who the fuck has done that???
@BlazeyBodynod @Carlybag @boofybristol @NikkiAcute I think thats what it comes down to. Tricky had some good points‚Ä¶ https://t.co/KTRLNH2uEu

@jayglassdubs I don't know what fragrance you are wearing but you've left a lovely scent in the shop
@_piezo I do slouch a bit, I‚Äôm getting closer to buying them by the minute üëü
@FutureTiming Thinking 300 or 520
If i'm thinking about buying some New Balance does it mean i've slipped a little too easily into the 35-44 demographic?
@originalesushi @HospitalRecords I think he is beyond that tbh
@tom_donuts looks lush!
Benji in the mix :) https://t.co/i7JvhdFs8y
@b_nmrrs @TheKellyTwins one of the highlights of the year #bitey #vampireagent

@KOEHLERSOUND @Hodgebristol 3 weeks of misery when you give up, but gets better after that
@Ruprecht1 Violife is decent, Sainsbury‚Äôs do one now as well. I‚Äôm trying to wean myself off normal cheese with mixed results ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@sellbydave yes Winterval could be a winner - it shold of course go without saying that IH is all the above :)
@boofybristol @Ruprecht1 yes - something snappy like that - in brackets 'Vegan friendly'
What's the best way to desrcibe Christmas that pisses off right wingers? You know 'Winter Festival' or whatever - asking for a friend
@TheKellyTwins what time you got to go fancy a drink before hand?
@zerabrixton @NTSlive Thank you :)
@schmorgasbord @Livity_Sound @NTSlive it's a west mids thing, you wouldn't understand

@ZebPuliZeb @rmccoley I can assure you it wasn‚Äôt, it was a little mongrel type thing whose owner had crafted crafted some dreads on it
@william_aspden Thanks will :)
@rmccoley @NoiseyMusic I liked some of that music - Libertines were great live - but the NME revlled in his drug us‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ot8ccVTA8i
@tony_poland Mix of old and new stuff - but all on the label :)

@boofybristol so frustrating, makes you sick
@tri_soundsystem @boomkatonline @gillespeterson @idlehandsrecs Ordered 2 for myself, strange they are doing it this‚Ä¶ https://t.co/kNgsMiw89T
@rhythmictheory i.e. Veganism is the whole deal, not just about diet. People hold their views dearly mate and I know you respect that.
@rhythmictheory Chips are vegan mate
@rhythmictheory Couldn't resist.
@TheKellyTwins The option no one speaks of
@LukeHaines_News a great songwriter reduced to his recreational habits, so much more to say about his music!
@TheKellyTwins since Shaun Ryder got clean, yes maybe
@anewlinerelated Think I changed the Insta handle when we moved postcode. I use SC so rarely I haven't updated it üëç
@OffkeyInd @disconihilist @pacific_rhythm for the record I like that sound, and mean no ill will to producers makin‚Ä¶ https://t.co/q5lNgoxpMY
@Ryn_Kdy cheers ryan :)
@jsugarlo which seems likely tbh, I don't think they have ever been strong on educating their members.
Got to say, I'm feeling this new Burial 10" - We've waited years for a dance floor 12" from him - not to everyone's taste but I like it
@jayglassdubs @BHeroique majestic!
@anton_maiof no but I do have a copy of that version lol
@BHeroique still need to do that edit of 'World In Motion'
@BHeroique lol, i've seen you play Bieber with a serious look on your face - or semi serious at least
@BHeroique BH wedding DJ set?
@ERoySound I used to use a trolley cart with box on top, but I recommend the magma's - got two of them and they have stood test of time
veggie/vegan friends - I've got a lump of smoked tofu in the fridge - looking for recipe suggestions - any help gratefully received
@Hodgebristol @codeinedrums Redders over yours and pev's set was great

@HarrySword lol, yeah the spinal tap nature of the statement has been pointed out to me - but fuck it, he's trying,‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WbWtjv7iXj
@TectonicPinch I need to do this
@_willobrien such a good version of it - the alternate mix on the 12" :)
@telfortmusic nice record that, not checked it before
@Chrisduck still chuckling about it today!
@booshed I can't speak, bit guilty of overusing filters myself üôâ
@booshed I bet he wanted a rotary as well
@jsugarlo your version is great, thanks for letting me cut it :)
@extrastereo @voyeurxxx actually a pretty decent DJ and label head, has a vampire as a booking agent, you know the usual
oh it gets better, now he's chatting about his 'gap yah'
@Apartment_rec real DJs go Premiere Inn
