Just got all my #ITN17 tickets! @CPPGlasgow HERE WE GO!!
@jennifer_maie absolutely true.
The people in the next hotel room have decided that our door should be "discipline door" where they think about their actions. And cry.

My heads been banging for like four days and I can't work out if it's because I'm sick, drinking too much/not enough coffee.
After the longest day ever I'm finally in a flat eating pizza.

@Pricksterrr @jennifer_maie @asiafaefacebook Hahahah thought I'd deleted it... Hilarious. But YES collaboration 😂😉
@asiafaefacebook when you can't be trusted with 2 Twitter accounts and reply from an RCS one. But... 100% truth.

Literally been cleaning for an event all day and my arms feel like they could fall off.
Officially matriculated for third year and it's making me so excited/a bit terrified. Anyone know how to write a dissertation?! 😫

When the sun comes out my 86 year old neighbour sunbathes entirely naked in the back garden.
@GudrunSoley Naaah the Icelandic nation are all frauds. Absolute reprobates over there btw.
@GudrunSoley so like when a word gets translated or a song. It's not exact. It's till trying to figure out why.
The term "chillaxing" actually gives me the boke.
I swear they've lived here for years just growing and scaring all the tenants away.

Megabus from Glasgow to Perth sitting next to the toilet and a man who is asleep and keeps falling into me. Nightmare journey!!!
I'm the most hungover shambles right now.
One of those nights when you try on every item of clothing you own only to wear the first thing you had on.
I got to cuddle a baby today and it made me so happy!
Trying to reapply for saas is more difficult than it should be.
@GudrunSoley thanks Iceland. Good to know I'm not alone!

Gudruns bday bash was real great.
So hungover and this man serving me coffee is WAAAAAYY too chatty.
That rain shower was a bit much.
