@ValdPerformance @das_shield hope to see this in action soon. Hope all is well Tony
A comprehensive review of fish oil supplementation for exercise performance. Great work @goose_angus @DrStuGray https://t.co/R1ko5aenHP
Do we need to ingest protein DURING exercise? Possibly not to improve performance https://t.co/3zrOFvO57Z
@benwarrington92 depends on your goals. For general health - probably. Recovery following exercise - probably.
@tomnoon89 Hi Tom. Which paper are you interested in? The ones on the screen?

Can adding n3PUFA improve recovery in soccer players? Come see my oral talk tomorrow (Thurs) 0800. 0.31&amp;0.32 OP-PM79. @ECSS2016 #ECSS2016
@TECFitness Interesting, certainly a potential mechanism. Will you be measuring collagen synthesis?
@TECFitness great info graphic. Can you hazard a guess as to the mechanism behind this?
@mariespano @StirNutrOW if you pass me on your email address I can forward you the poster if you like?
@TommmyLundberg @stirproftip @StirNutrOW come visit my poster on Saturday morning for more in depth info on this study!
@SheratonBoston Hi,  i emailed a couple of days ago regarding an upcoming visit. Did you receive this? Thanks
Listen (and watch) @stirproftip discuss current fish oil research going on @ @HESRGUnStirling. Interesting findings. https://t.co/iWR6Yfoq4M
@ScienceOfMuscle @FitnessExpose @MarkWright_ he just ran really fast. A mile a minute
@ScienceOfMuscle just making sure I eat right and take my medication and I'm okay. Having a busy life doesn't help tho
@ScienceOfMuscle as a man with Crohns Disease I feel your pain!

Would u like more?
@ScienceOfMuscle @sftgym This is horrendous. Can you show me any sort of scientific research showing that sleep deprivation is appropriate
@ISICGlobal Sorry to waste your time. Found in my junk mail. Thanks for your time
@ISICGlobal Hi. I ordered a ISIC card this morning. Should i receive a email conformation? Thanks

Interesting look at the work going on involving Vitamin D. Does supplementation of VitD have health benefits? https://t.co/jKuSsWGLzT
@ScienceOfMuscle any sceptics should give this a listen http://t.co/1OztGWGG1K
@ScienceOfMuscle true that. Keep up the good work, really enjoy your account #science
@ScienceOfMuscle 100% agree. The worrying thing is, people will believe these 'gurus' and take their advice!
@ScienceOfMuscle where have you seen this? What a terrible idea!
@CelebrityCruise agreed. Captured a cracking view of the boat itself http://t.co/euHQY4LIJk

@benwarrington92 @NateDuncanNBA This is horrible, he needs to head to a team where he can be a key contributing factor #dragicoversuns
@dlhamilton82 @Emilia_SportSci @stirproftip @JoeParish9 we are just scratching the surface. A lot more research is vital
