Can't believe I'm being trusted to cook the dinner
I hate Timehop sometimes, there's just some things I don't want to be reminded of
Can't wait to wake up on Christmas Day with my little family in our new home💓

Moving house next week is gonna be so stressful
Wee successful Black Friday shop😛
So sleep deprived yet can't fucking sleep😴😴😴😴
Life really is too short for regrets
These next three weeks need to fly by 👨‍👩‍👧🏡🗝
More folk need to realise it's nice to be fucking nice
Almost everyone's snapchat stories are takeaways the night
Honestly beyond me how girls just bounce back to their normal figure straight after having babies, I still look a good 6 month preggo🙃🙃
Dunno why I even have Timehop when almost all of the throwbacks just give me the fear 🤔
Today is deffo one of those days
Not being able to get back to sleep after a night feed is a killer 😴
Actually gonna miss Ryan so much once his paternity leave us over 😕
Keep looking at Emilie and just crying with happiness😍 she's so perfect
2 days!!!!! #comeonbaby
Less than a week till Ryan and I become parents😍😍 honestly cannot wait to meet her
Road trip with Chloe the day 🤙🏼
Everything's starting to feel so real now
Wish something would go my way for a change..😓
Seriously pisses me off when folk share videos of animal cruelty on Facebook
