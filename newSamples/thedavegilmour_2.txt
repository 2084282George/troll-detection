@kweh I've just written a sentence with two semi-colons. What do you infer from that?
@BrianRobertson8 what have you been reading...?
@sammy_robinson1 I'm not angry at them, just disappointed.                                                 And very, very angry.
@BrianRobertson8 I actually hate my past-self. That guy is responsible for a lot of the biggest problems in my life.
@BrianRobertson8 I remember enjoying it, but I think it might have been a bit of filler between Year Zero and Endgame.
@BrianRobertson8 me!
Who Rae? #BINDA16
IT'S HAPPENING! STEPHEN WALLACE IS IN THE DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENT'S SEAT! #binda16
Salubrious. One-up from the DS.  #binda16
@Unco0rdinated it means more than once. That's why he kept saying it.
If Stephen Wallace doesn't get a commendation, it's a disgrace. #binda16
@bequietamy I'm game if you are!
@JohnLindamcm That's ok, I got a KFC and brought it back to the Church- who needs friends? Love you guys!
@sammy_robinson1 can't believe you've got your phone out in Church

@mick_k86 I know, they've made table tennis a joke.
@mick_k86 ahh, that's cool. Just roll on over to Seapark, we'll be waiting for you.
@carly_maxwell13 that's what you get for standing too close to @Phil_Hoy1
Water fight at NYI tonight! You're all mine, suckers. #wetwetwet
@MeBeVikki don't forget about quoting Cyclops!
@JamesClarkson96 lucky you! I remember when I got holidays....
@bhrome yeah, just finished it earlier. Great to learn more about one of the guys behind my favourite fictional universe!
@bhrome just listened to you on Saving the Game- really enjoyed it, thanks for your insights! Part 2 is on the list for today.
@tanita2507 @sammy_robinson1 @mick_k86 working hard at W5...
@sammy_robinson1 @mick_k86 too slow, suckers!
@mick_k86 @williamr90 it was going so well until the last line of the write-up- "our favourite marvel mutant"? I think not.
@JamesClarkson96 me too man, the next assembly is too far away!
@neverner1990 whoops, that was supposed to have a ? at the end!
@Unco0rdinated have to stop you there...I'm the cutest thing ever. We had a vote.
Thank you, Lord, for #NazDA13-  how you spoke up, showed up, and stirred up. You're so good. No reserves, no retreats and no regrets. Amen.
300 words? #NazDA13
No business like Naz business. #NazDA13
@Unco0rdinated doctors have said that my awesome levels are dangerously high.
@clarebear60 thought about any names yet?
@clarebear60  Just heard the big news- congratulations! #soexcited
What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus. #NazDA13
@clarebear60 get better soon, man- don't want to miss the #NazDA13 train!
#NazDA13 #nyuk2013 bogies
#NazDA13 #nyuk2013 willy Robinson scrumpled up my ballot paper. Can the president rebuke him please?
#nyuk2013 #NazDA13 wouldn't want to
be in Matt's house tonight.
@JulieCPatterson thought I'd got it deleted before anyone noticed! Too quick for me Julie.

@Phil_Hoy1 just been retweeted by Deadpool! Life now complete. #diehappy
@BrianRobertson8 @the_sandizzle @mick_k86 my favourite comment was, "you should see the sock spinning at their homeless outreach services!"
@sammy_robinson1 I didn't, but it sounds like a table quiz question waiting to happen!
@JohnLindamcm reasonable! What about you guys?
@Connorpattzz that's exactly what he's saying. http://t.co/avBzkl94
@WordAction thanks so much for this- my son Nathan and I have just went through it together and both of us loved it! Good work &amp; God bless!
Spent all day working on the NYI Weekend- #soexcited
@mick_k86 honestly, I'm a little bit hurt you even have to ask. I'll bring it along on Sunday.
@erin_watterson hi erin, Carrick Larne NYI loves you and everything you stand for!
@real_liam_payne hi, I'm sitting near Charlotte and she just wanted to say hi, and she loves you so much it's a bit weird.
@robertpatinson_ hi, I'm sitting beside Alannah, and she wanted to say that she loves you so much she might actually die right now.
@channingtatum hi, we're a Church youth group and the girls wanted to say they love you loads. Would you like to visit us?
Less than 2 weeks until Inside/Out, @carricklarnenyi 's home mission. Make sure you sign up before it's too late!
@carricklarnenyi Senior Leaders, brace your inboxes- it's an admin day.
Just booked @carricklarnenyi 's next trip- Room 2 Race on the 28th of April. Going to be a great night!
A bit stupid today. Cooked pizza with polystyrene base still attached, then dropped yoghurts on front step like a small fruity hand grenade.
@sammy_robinson1 Sold! I'd love to have been in the room when someone pitched this idea.
@sammy_robinson1 I might buy a digital watch....
Another social medium I've entered purely to communicate with our youth! Hope you guys appreciate it....
