Can't wait to get out of this lab and celebrate St. Paddy's day! I'm sure I'm a little bit Irish!
Working on this lab project every day is soul destroying..at least I can narrow down my career search.

Tutors that organise a tutorial for 4pm on a Friday, then don't turn up, should be killed #justsaying
