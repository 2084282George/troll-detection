sadly most journeys by bike a bit impractical, public transport is shitty
Particularly magic being woken up by heavy rain when you've got a day at home doing good stuff with music
Woof what a sprint! What a champ!

The Vuelta is so good, but it's almost unbearable every year because it marks the end of so many dreamy things.
Been nothing but a funny old day and I don't want it to end really.
Here's a pretty one https://t.co/PJayDrp07I

Made a cape, seen some good shit, laughed like dicks, nearly blew a speaker, hanging with RAD PALS - SUPERNORMAL
I'm kinda mid-point. Filled w' a dreamy longing 4 wonderful travels but also a dreamy anticipation of supreme moments, inc airing my techno
@RanoRanoRano_ Looking great! Bit jealous actually
Who cares about the 'top 50' of anything? Everybody likes summit different. Goodness me, yawn-o-rama
