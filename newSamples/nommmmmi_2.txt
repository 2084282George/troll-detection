Just sent in my application for a funded PhD because I may as well start getting paid to never leave university. #wishfulthinking
I am "none of my clothes fit me comfortably and i hate everybody who tells me how huge i am" weeks pregnant.
PSA. If one more person tells me I’m huge I’ll eat them. https://t.co/aYWD7jSbpW

@rach_hopper I was thinking of some sketchers.. any recommendations? 😂
Today i learned that an 8 mile hike while 6 months pregnant feels like an 80 mile hike 😴😴😴😴
Currently stressed about not having time to be stressed about all the stuff that’s causing me stress right now.
@rach_hopper I was surprised I didn’t cry 😂😂😂
I am “watching puppy videos and crying a lot” weeks pregnant
@tim_fall Thankyou! Hoping tricky pregnancy = easy baby!

Anyone else watch friends for the first time after getting “woke” to activism and intersectionality and realise it’s actually awful?
@SusannaHawkins1 I wish I’m only 23 weeks, just massive and had every side effect under the sun 😩 so exhausted!
@sammy_robinson1 Mate don’t I’m still somewhat in denial 😂
Have the Sunday night fear... two months to go 😩😩😩
@neevcochrane Hahaha mate let’s not go into your 2012 tweets 😂😂😂
Pregnancy cravings are all fine until you desperately want Cajun chicken from Candy’s in Montrose and you live in Glasgow 😩😩😩
@bequietamy It should be 0 days!!!

@TattooedTeaLady Hairy Bikers go veggie is decent :)
Such a weird, cool, lovely wee feeling when baby kicks. There’s an actual person growing inside me.
11 weeks of placement, 18 weeks until qualification, 20 weeks until we meet our boy. Let’s go 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Woke from a 2 hour nap cause I could smell food and that’s pregnancy pretty much summed up.
2018 will be the first year in about a decade i will not go on a diet or buy into the diet industry. 2018 is only f… https://t.co/om8LXy60zC
My only New Years Resolutions are to graduate without having a breakdown and not completely fail at parenting.
@amy_edwards94 Mate. Every time!
2018 is going to be an intense one!
Got to see our wee baby today. Best Christmas present ever 👶🏻😍 https://t.co/HDVV0lCLny
Last Christmas without a baby... 😱
Trying to submit a PhD application and realising you’ve grossly overestimated your academic capabilities https://t.co/MKZ8iAOjFc
My neighbours just gave us a Christmas card and it was exclusively for our dog 😂
Only two more days until that sweet, sweet out of office goes on for 11 glorious days 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
@NerdAboutTown Im the same. Lateness just says “I value my time more than I value yours” it’s so disrespectful 🤨
@kiwipendleton You’re a dream 😍

@oawoodward THIS is one of the greatest ideas ever!!
I don't love being pregnant so far but I am pure amazed that my body is actually growing a proper wee person.

Just ordered a pram 😍😍
So weird planning for next year and having to consider baby sitters 😱😱
My favourite thing about pregnancy is being sick and crying all the time for no reason. 🙃
Streak so far without being sick - 1 day. Thought I was getting 2 but nahhhh. #15weeks
To do 2018: complete a masters, apply for (and hopefully start) a PhD, look after small human being currently growing inside me. TERRIFYING.
@rach_hopper She’s a beauty! Ohh man I have loads 😂 I’m non stop throwing up right now so not loving it but hopefully that’ll pass soon! X
