Feud or Little Women? What do I pick first?
The rest of the workforce before Christmas... https://t.co/Y5hgfsnmca
Brilliant #IbizaClassics from @petetong &amp; @julesbuckley https://t.co/I5u1aMHfyX
Is it just London buses that permanently smell of weed? Or all buses?
@Labelfilm I’ve got a feeling it’s going to be a good series.

@bradwright sorry try @TheWeekUK
When did @instagram stop being just squares? Just updated the app and 😱
@mo6020 offer to help? 😜
I feel pretty much as excited by Bake Off as I do by Christmas. So cosy.

@FariBrad @iandeeley Jazz Standard is pretty interesting in that way: https://t.co/tIy5imh85n
@iandeeley nope! Jazz FM, Jazz Now on Radio 3, Jazz Standard, Jamie Cullum....
@OhDanMoss ohhhh.
@mo6020 there's always Tottenham...
@Dr_Paul_Thomas ahh hope all ok 👌🏽
Old street restaurant recommendations? I may work here every day but I don't know 🤷🏻‍♀️
@claraamfo I've never been able to deal with being in there, had the world's most awkward meeting - basically me saying what?! constantly 😳
@leonrestaurants I love you but this surely isn't £2.50 worth of fries? https://t.co/FGFMacvyV6
5) getting to work with some super talented DJs &amp; producers incl. @jamzsupernova @DJSemtex @DJTrevorNelson @djedu @seanibremix #1XtraAt15
3) Doing the Sunday night drum and bass shift when I was a Broadcast Assistant #1XtraAt15
Some of my fav moments working with @1Xtra over the years...1) Putting on Xtra Bass 2006 at @ministryofsound when I booked fri nights there
@samuelbailey @Deb_ramz @TinaDaheley 🤢🤢
Can't wait to watch this, amazing work @benjanilowe @Chris_Stark &amp; your team https://t.co/87QzJNKGeH
@mo6020 the struggle is real!! I wouldn't go that far though 😜
I spend about 90% of my non-work time thinking about nice stuff that I want to buy for the house, which I can't buy.
@mo6020 if so what do you do with your evenings if you're not playing the rightmove game??
Currently experiencing the peak of working parenthood - writing a pitch whilst simultaneously ordering school uniform 🥋
@LoxleyBiz @TheTantrumTimes Oh dear, our house is pretty much all white emulsion 😬, no off-ing here 😜
@LoxleyBiz excellent tiles though!!
@LoxleyBiz wow that looks gorgeous 😍😍
@LoxleyBiz @TheTantrumTimes so good!!
@London_Lou I'm preempting the spoilers. Clearly you know better tho 😜
Blimey he's having a bad week 🤦🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/E5pcxFqjqr
This is incredible and, hopefully, a misquote, or taken out of context, because if not then ?! https://t.co/0bXDkxV6PK
@mo6020 I have nothing to offer except sympathy. I ranted to them about irony / waste of working parent's time trying to sort 30 hours 😤
@rosieseed 55.5?!
I wish I was her, when I was 18 I was listening to drum &amp; bass, social media didn't exist but was about to make its time sucking entrance.
@CAMaile 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Any tips on watching Channel 4 abroad on computer?? I cannot miss Handmaids Tale 😱
Today I had my first ever @leonrestaurants breakfast. I now want it for breakfast every day.
@okidomagazine @DesignMuseum ahhh we're on holiday for the one, will there be more?
@mo6020 @LeanneBenson we were pretty bad at it as I remember - the height match was not good, apparently you need a good match 😊
@mo6020 thrifty
Audio friends - any tips on if there is a place where people share instrumentals that don't need licensing for podcast use?
Just remembered that I must get a @metalheadzmusic Christmas jumper this year before they sell out. Need to remember in December now.
@HMRCcustomers oh dear. Thanks anyway.
@HMRCcustomers hopefully - is it possible to DM? I have a childcare account query.
😮 https://t.co/Gxbq2hLrxv
Why didn't anyone tell me that there is a new series of Fargo and it has started already?
In my bag I have a pair of pants and three trains but NO phone charger lead 🤦🏻‍♀️
Hearing @richiehawtin on @BBCworldservice is the best... https://t.co/uNeSdiHdUC
@LoxleyBiz @Wilkins_Co blimey I didn't realise you couldn't before 😱
Need your 5000 words idea slimmed down to 500? I am the person to do it.
Handmaids Tale episode 2, still terrifying. Can't breathe with the tension.
@maryannehobbs @rootycall excellent - thank you!
@TheUnmumsyMum @Dove how odd??
@matt @talia oh good I'll look forward to those then 😭😂
Loving @AnnieMac's @BBCR1 @GlastoFest show - chaotically brilliant &amp; live, high point being a topless @jackmaster https://t.co/TzJJOmi1TL
@brettsr @thisisnextradio 😄
