I'm absolutely loving out here☺️
😳😳😰😰😭😭 http://t.co/KNUNnHdG10
@neevcochrane what you getting..?
It's crazy to think I won't see Saz again until the middle of December😶
And on the plus side I only ruined a couple of the bridal party photos which I'm pretty proud of😂
So nervous to get my jags today😬😬
@neevcochrane that looks amazing 😍😋
I really do miss not being able to chat to her every night before bed
Have had absolutely no energy at all today 😭
When I focus my dad to complain about our Chinese tonight and there now sending us 2 free meals 💁💁#Winner
@nommmmmi I know right, it looks like she done an amazing job and excited to see all the photo☺️
When Saz open my snapchat and she doesn't reply💔I don't even care if she not the only one I've sent it to, as a sister she's meant to reply😏
It's such a weird feeling facetiming Saz cause now we have to make time to speak to each other unlike before!
And no better way to end it by having a nerf gun fight with 25 people 😊
Nothing makes me more happier than going to see Saz on Thursday and getting to see her and Ryan's new house ☺️☺️
Already feel like it's gonna be an emotional night for Laura Coops 😣
@blameitonchar aww thanks😘 hopefully 💗
I legit feel so ill and it's only 4 days until saz and Ryan's wedding😭 #PleasePrayForMe🙏
I honestly hate packing so much 😩😭
Now that's what I like to see😁😁😁 http://t.co/N9SYATy6mI
In only 3weeks and 3days 😳😳😳😳
@blameitonchar ohhh that's a hard one😁 I'm finished it 😭 just waiting for the another season to come out now☺️
@blameitonchar **❤️
@blameitonchar I know right! What episode you on?  ❤️
The thought of me getting up at 6:15 tomorrow morning makes me wanna cry!
So excited for today😁☺️
It's only my luck that I would get the cold 4 days before Saz's hen party 😭
@neevcochrane very thankful that you came today though!
So sad that I had to take out my bridesmaids hairstyle this morning I wish I could have kept it in longer but Saz's say no 😥
Running tonight was so brutal 😣
So frecking nervous for my bridesmaids dress fitting on Thrusday 😬😬
I feel like I'm in a dream☺️ never been so excited ever😁 http://t.co/f3mBeaSwif
😂😂 http://t.co/RWF7ZYl18Z
I never use to understand how people could enjoy running but now I do and how good you feel after it ☺️
I can't believe Saz moves out in less than 4 months😳 time has gone by so fast!
Was a little disappointed today! I thought it would have been a blackout! http://t.co/3B4IRffn6U
I feel so embarrassed for Madonna😬
@blameitonchar wow😱😂
So excited for this weekend away but I absolutely hate packing 😣
She's the sweetest/thoughtful person ever ☺️❤️ http://t.co/duaCL5UBZW
So my alarm is set for 7am 😭😭
I totally suck at being healthy 😭😭 http://t.co/mLJ8ShGCQA
Silent witness is gotta be my favourite tv program these days!
@sarahw012 @HannahClarkson8 yeah you better be 😉
Afternoon with Saz turn out watching Cinderella, tangled and then having a nap (yeah I know it sounds like a 3 year olds afternoon)😄
So me and Saz decided to make snow angels at 11:30pm 😊👭 http://t.co/s6230b4VcH
@goodchxrlotte O my days!!! Why did you do that😳 you're crazy! Yeah! Hahaha! You gotta love her!
@goodchxrlotte honestly don't rush it charlotte!!! It's the worst feeling ever when it's finished😭
@goodchxrlotte wait what 😳 when is it coming out...? ❤️
@chels_annie me and Saz both tried it tonight and i was exhausted like at the half way point 😂(I'm so unfit if you can't tell)
It's actually pretty sad how our friendship doesn't even exist anymore.
But there always a downside Saz moves out this year too😥
Last night was such a great night 😊 http://t.co/3bqb1L8jqJ
It's way to light outside to get to sleep 😭😭
@kiwistarks10 how long are you planning..? A year maybe(that would be fab) 🙏🙏🙏
@kiwistarks10 missing you already! July is too far away 😥
So Saz woke me up this morning by jumping on my bed (I asked her why she did and her reply was cause I never get the chance to do it again)
So me and Saz just put up our Christmas decorations just in time 😅😎
So excited to see @sarahwilsonnnn today!!!
So having that MacDonald's tonight probably wasn't the best idea! Feeling pretty ill now 😷😷
@kiwistarks10 awww 🙊 (yeah lucky she doesn't) 😂 love you Kari Starks 💙
So the stressful bit is done bought and wrapped everyone's presents! So excited for Christmas now !!! 💜
@JamesClarkson96 why don't you just get the bus
Wearing heels for the first time in ages #PrayingIDon'tFall 😬
So I think little Lauren has Eastie to dance with her about 20 times 🙊 she so damm cute
So thought Saz bought me a Christmas present as a superdry delivery came through the door but NO she just bought herself a new dress 😭💔
Why the heck can you not just take what I'm saying to you serious for once 😏
Wow! Thanks guys! 👍 http://t.co/gsPC6k4WWZ
Sainsburys Christmas advert makes me want to cry with happiness 🎄
@kiwistarks10 aww I'm glad you did 😊 love you too and can't wait to see you at Christmas 😁❤️
What an amazing weekend in Erskine with these beautiful girls💜 http://t.co/4PjmmZ90cC

@HannahClarkson8 @sarahwilsonnnn #Winner
Think this was the first fireworks night I hadn't felt like I've had frostbite #Winner
@Mr_Smithable #Winner
I absolutely love my bridesmaids dress 😝
Like Saz moves out in like 9 months 😳
Can't believe we're going brides and bridesmaids dress shopping tomorrow for Saz and Ryan's wedding 😁😁
@itsonlyalix what really 😬
I swear my parents are hoarders, trying to clean out the kitchen and bin things seems to be impossible when there in the house!
What I don't understand is how a person can tell you so many lies and never feel bad about it.
@JamesClarkson96 #Don'tBeJel 😬
Little Bethy told me I was her best friend today, how cute is she ☺️
@sarahw012 your so like me 😂😂❤️
My mum is honestly so funny but not a lot of people will know cause she's so dam quite.
@IonaLucy wow 😳 that's super late for you 😂❤️
@goodchxrlotte maybe one day your dream will come true 😉❤️❤️
Love a night in with my fav 👯👯
Today has been a rubbish day 😞
@sarahw012 I do 😬😂
So they no chance I'm being brunette for Saz and Ryan's wedding so I guess I'm going back blonde tomorrow
@sarahw012 aww☺️ to be honest I don't know what I would do without you 👭
@sarahw012 #SozSaz #LoveYouReally 😉☺️
I'm so disgusted what people are actually writing on the internet because it wasn't yes
