@dearlucy not always 😀👋🏼
@bradwright I like @TheWeek, not necessarily left but an interesting round up. Had to unfollow The Guardian a while ago for same reasons.
Loved judging the #UKARIAS17 for the @radioacademy this year, so good hearing such high quality audio. Congrats to all the nominees 🙌🏼

Holidays before kids, return to work: oh I feel soooo relaxed. Holidays after kids, return to work: I'm exhausted, pass the coffee.
