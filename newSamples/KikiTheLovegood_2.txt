@GryffindorGirl_ they are great! I love lavender so much and pastels are basically pure cuteness! :-)
@GryffindorGirl_ well Leaky is only once a year and the museum is there all year long so I'm sure you can go there one day :+)
@GryffindorGirl_ omg that's amazing! I wanted to go to amsterdam this summer but I couldn't! :( I hope I can go there next year!
I literally can't wait for autumn because big jumpers + hot soy chocolates + leave collages + fog + rain + rain coats + thick socks
I'm actually leaving the house today to meet up with friends in town, it feels like this happened the last time in 1456 or smt
constantly torn between dying my hair a pastel colour, light grey or ginger
@SamiLovegood I miss youu!! &lt;3
want to do so much stuff but I'm to lazy/sleepy
Is it odd that I'm super exited that my text books for the next school year arrived? #nerd
Leslie Rose is my love
I finished Got season 3, my life has no meaning anymore
my transformation into a cute granny is nearly complete now that I have a necklace for my glasses and flowery birkenstocks :+)
