@unsound nasty atmosphere for group of friends coming here for years. I can point him out. He's bald, overweight, and looks like a pervert
@unsound but really, the main point would be: make this feel like a safe(r) space and remove the rotund balding fellow who keeps eyeing gals
@unsound time to rotate the security staff in room 2. Pervy boggiss bunch and beane up in here killing the vibe
Completely packed room for the Technoactivism discussion @unsound KRK with @DISCWOMANNYC extended family. Love seeing such a turnout. Crewww
If you accidentally walk into a venue (artists' studios) door, and smash the glass, do you pay for it? Or let Sisters Uncut foot the bill?

Kenny Loggins' "Footloose" desperately needs the brutal club rework treatment. Wonder if my MPC's up to it...
