Like nerding out about electronic music? I've been loving @LineNoisePod (podcast) with @PhilipSherburne &amp; @bencardew https://t.co/1PhJjzJZkE
@tomcrabtree If you want to talk shop about OD-11s @tobiastoft has refurbished some originals. (But Sonos is the way to go for an office).
Episode art this month is is by @simonstalenhag (thx @GambleLee). Ordered his 1st book. https://t.co/cnFO3DGkuE https://t.co/qYyfbdU6UI
@sterlingcrispin was two blocks away, didn't know the opening was today @bitforms, thanks!
@tomcrabtree Everything from the products to the site are just so damn good. Ceramic Edition Watch in my future. Hard not to be a fanboy.

@RickWebb For example, if I leave my house to go for a run without my phone the AirPods would know that and do the right thing.
The holy trinity of consumer electronics. Phone+Watch+AirBuds. Basically the new iPod+iTunes. Same ol' game. Lock it down and do it better.
Oh my, this is turning out righteously @flimshaw! https://t.co/84mH1P0qj8
Instagram stories UI is one of the best examples of the maddening relationship between familiarity and usability. Snapchat wasn't "usable".
@zacksears New to NYC and just dropped you a note (@pieratt strikes again)
@elialtman the GarbagePailKids version of this craze
@elialtman thanks man, look me up next time you are there.
@elialtman print is yours for the small fee of picking it up in the Mission. Buy/sell/trade. Cash4gold.
@ashleyluvspizza Baumkuchen! Arigat≈ç gozaimasu! @brandonnn Douzo meshiagare!
Bumped into the YouTube playlists of @materialobject &amp; @Atom_TM_news's label @no_wares. Made my night. https://t.co/m8bAUTh8EZ
@CJN The comments from Dimitri Hegemann about a sense of peacefulness in their mastery and a quality similar to 90 year old vines were ace.
Some of the most memorable conversations with VCs last year (while pitching @wovewear) were about their take on fashion. ü§ê
@ashleyluvspizza I was talking to @arlojamrog about this the other night. Pretty weird to see, but makes sense.
@rileycran @pieratt can't miss @dashwoodbooks !

Solidifying tradition of flying into Burbank, dropping bags and immediately eating at @SQIRLLA. Better every time.

@bruces friend goes outside to smoke leaving you alone at an empty tenderloin bar on a Monday to LOL profusely at "Parsey McParseface"
@CJN @heyitsnoah when can I expect his first release? What are we talking here? 4th wave neurofunk or post-vapor drone?
Serendipitously @GambleLee released my soundtrackt to flipping through "Spirit is a Bone" today (along with a video) https://t.co/FXHsH2ZFd4
‚ÄúSpirit is a Bone‚Äù - picked up a copy @dashwoodbooks last week. https://t.co/t6gSEKWj7A https://t.co/9C4NCJuH2K
@abe1x Yes! The more the better. If there aren't channels for sub-genres of music I'm not innit.
@heyitsnoah the comment at the end about experience is spot on. But man is it annoying. I NEVER seem to have taken a bite when they ask.
Also prompted me to cancel Spotify and signup for @SoundCloud GO (where I really "discover") so I can save offline for a flight tomorrow.
@RickWebb I need those reissues too maaaan. I'd also like to see them live again soon.
@domgoodrum Great album upon first listen. I will always prefer the earlier sparse dark stuff, but this is a good transition.
@2xlp @RickWebb True, I'm still using it and liking it. Mainly so I don't have to think about what's on my phone and how much space is left.
@2xlp @rickwebb This explains it clearly, wew. - https://t.co/clwULkfE79
@RickWebb @2xlp okay last one guys, I give up. From that linked support article... https://t.co/7JGmurBUPY
@2xlp @RickWebb since the post took off I'm trying to figure out if there is a badly behaving feature I don't know about or what?
@2xlp @rickwebb I saw a few things randomly disappear locally around that time but haven‚Äôt since. Still scared, but I have FLAC backups.
@RickWebb I'm still unclear about when iCloud Music Library will remove songs from your HD without asking? Terrifying.
@fascinated Aaaaand, I'm down the üêáhole... Still going to finish this ravioli though.
Wow, fascinating read. I'm probably irrationally biased against corporate campuses and suburbia, but still... https://t.co/mXYPPZWSNd
@tobyjoe July one My wife and I roll into Chinatown with two upset cats and a WHOLE bunch of baggage from Silicon Valley. Need storage space

@CJN that album put a permanent dent in me. So damn good. Just the right touch of Portishead / Massive Attack vibes.
@KyleBlue Hey! I sent a note to a gmail address I had for you yesterday. Psyched to catchup and hang on the regular.

@buzz been waiting for someone to base their IA on content, not apps. Hints of it w/ Siri but still feels like crawling in/out of apps.
