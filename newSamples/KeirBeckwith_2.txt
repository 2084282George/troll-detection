Can’t sleep am raging
Don’t know why but whenever a hear the house phone ring, a always biff out thinking it’s the police
Heads scrambled
Am I missing something or has my snapchat not changed??
Why say something if you have no intention of following through???
Is it even Sunday if you don’t sit in your bed watching Netflix feeling heavy depressed questioning how you’ve had… https://t.co/KIYgxSHlAJ
Happy Birthday Fave cousin x @ohhiindia https://t.co/NcPOxRnIMT
Could go a big box of chips and cheese
So brutal trying to have a decent chat with someone who’s got 0 patter
People who put their feet up on chairs in restaurants/bars are the worst type of people
A need to stay off my phone when am tired, actual worse than when am drunk
Aw fucked it
Tonight’s my first proper night out since NYE and after my behaviour that night am feart to touch a drink

Doing shots on dates is the way forward
A wish a understood people’s thought processes
Honestly disgusted with myself
Wanting to be there for someone but not being able to is brutal
Genuinely think I could have a mental breakdown any second now
Weird how one text can completely change everything
I’m the absolute worst for drunk texting people
Clock is ticking
Surely people get bored of talking about themselves 24/7???
Tinder when you’ve been drinking is risky, the next day is just full of regret
Would love to go another Christmas school dance 😭
Kinda want to change my name
Somehow don’t think my car would pass it’s service, thanks tho x https://t.co/OI1wB9iZgW
Feel like going to the beach and just waiting for the wind to blow me away
Why are uber drivers always getting phone calls?? Why they so popular? Why am I not getting phone calls?
It’s a horrible feeling knowing someone is being the person you wanted to be but could never be
Speaking to the same person 24/7 for months and then it suddenly stopping one day is honestly one of the weirdest and hardest things ever 💭
I hate how shite my will power is, stop texting them, idiot!
Cucumber water is a game changer
I swear, going to sleep on bad terms with someone you love is the worst thing ever
It makes me sad that I’m too tall for a bath😢
Ever say something then instantly regret it? Same

Can a plumber dm me, i made it worse
Monday’s are bad enough, but Monday’s hungover are on a different level
“Never say goodbye because goodbye means going away and going away means forgetting”
My life has really came into perspective these last few days
My temper is so short it’s a joke, always do something in a rage and 5 mins later regret it
Is it too soon to wear a Christmas jumper??
What a joke @EE 😴😴😴 https://t.co/LKk0giHadx
Could go a mcflurry rn
@saskiabertschy_ A was braking to go round a corner when a fox ran out and when a swerved my wheels locked and a went flying through a wall

“Not everyone you lose is a loss”
Finally move into my flat in Edinburgh in a week, so buzzing to have my own place again
Forcing yourself to not talk to someone you’re used to being around 24/7 is torture even when you know it’s for the best
My whole world has turned upside down in 24 hours, I genuinely can’t cope
Hardest lesson I’ve learnt is that everyone will let you down. Sooner or later, it’ll happen
Watching someone you love accept the fact they’re about to pass away is honestly the worst thing I’ve ever experienced
What a joke
Stuck between wishing you'd never met someone and wishing they’d never leave
My gut instinct is rarely wrong, a think I might be psychic
One lie can make you question every single thing someone’s ever said to you
Not gonna lie this isn’t going the way a wanted it to
Sitting on a train and I have 3 Chinese men sleeping beside me, one literally on my shoulder. Why me???
Just had a banging steak at work and even that didn’t bring me out this shite mood
