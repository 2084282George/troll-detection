The Slowest Lift album is really great and not just because of the Duran Duran cover.

Never noticed the Totoro toy in Toy Story 3 before.
@WovenSkull and @GnodGnetwerk were worth staying up for.

I see Bill Orcutt and Chris Corsano are touring Europe in March. Nobody thought to bring them to Ireland, no?
Who‚Äôs got a DSL cable for me?
This has got to be the Sundayest of Sundays.
@Bandcloud Thanks. Listening to a live set now. Very nice.
@Bandcloud The Diaphane track is a keeper. Any release info?

@kobinaireland The search function is poor anyway.
Well @weareie? https://t.co/SmemXa4CFO
@Bandcloud D.Glare too! The first track would have been the perfect soundtrack for yesterday's walk through the fog.
@Bandcloud Goh Lee Kwang played at Lazybird way back in 2004, I think. No input mixer, if I recall. (@PriorGavin?)

@Bandcloud It's exactly the kind of thing that I should love but I don't. It's only all right at best.
