@mogwai_poet (I'm just saying I don't think u can just _decide_ to call a game something that it is labeled as nowhere in-game.) (Or can u?)
@jessekanda I am very happy you have returned to music. To this day I have to pull out "Doki" now and then.
@bleatingheart @loudmouthjulia @JustinMcElroy Can u explain 2 me how/why Frog Fractions 2 is called "Frog Fractions 2" and not "TXT WORLD!"?

@gorillavsbear Her self titled album from last year was my #1 album of 2014. Absolutely superb record, and probably up your alley.

I just got nauseous cos I thought about how many DJs must name their dog/cat "DJ _____" and call it "Deedge" for short.
@yogarecords Quiltland's self-titled album is the best in the genre right now IMO. Not sure if she considers herself new age though.
