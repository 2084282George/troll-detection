@deankissick both patlabor and GITS are also weirdly nostalgic but your not sure what about. Patlabor 2 is best, same dir as GITS.
@deankissick I love both of them, ost same guy as GITS. V slow and a tad boring but that's part of why I love them. https://t.co/KsIn6MYIh5
@deankissick but probably closer to ghost in the shell or patlabor? Everything is a bit serene, melancholic and high tech but hopeful!

@NINEIRON08 @AsherEinhorn @Soulhunter59 I think you may be talking about two things at the same time
@NINEIRON08 @AsherEinhorn @Soulhunter59 @femfreq yes but how often is a external also internalised
@NINEIRON08 @AsherEinhorn @Soulhunter59 @femfreq simple ideas like a female/poc main character can make a huge difference
@NINEIRON08 @AsherEinhorn @Soulhunter59 @femfreq there is no censorship going on
