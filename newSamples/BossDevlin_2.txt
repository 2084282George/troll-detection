@IMAndrey that dude wasn't given enough attention as a child ðŸ˜’
@IMAndrey on the real a lot of the money is credit. Advances, funds from managers, Apple...if you blow up you can pretend you always had it
@GODBODYJONES South Eastern Conference, like colleges with big frat parties in the spring lol.
@shantydorm @DeweySaunders @TURNSTILEHC it's dope. He flipped the script (again?!)
@TimothyL_ @alshipley these days he holds a special place in my heart for dancing on a treadmill to the most beta song ever written
Truth is rappers make squat on streams and earn cash by charging D3 colleges 20k for a show and putting expensive electronics on the rider
I'm a feminist because if men get their way by 2050 everything will either be whisky or IPA flavored

There's a point in every musicians career when u quit being a fucking amateur. That is when u call your tracks "records" instead of "songs"
@alexschelldorf i think they've started smoking the devil's arugula
Position: teacher.
Hours: a lot.
Pay: basically nada but you get a fat bonus if you can plug a kid in the skull from 100 yards with a glock
3) they've always had great dynamics but this is kinda flat 4) he says "fuck" so I'm guessing they finally quit being "christian" metalcore?
@somanyshrimp @Subpremedub @adam22 @BlocBoy_JB I do not know 10 white rappers
I'm not even fucking done. Post Malone, Juicy J, Flaming Lips, Action Bronson and....Andrew WK?? Let me reiterate: this is $125 for 3 days.
@NA_recs @tristan_bath hmmmmm
I know it's whiteopolis but if I had to pick a small town in the South to live in, it would be Asheville
@ezra_marc so far so good... https://t.co/rUBCdLWGh6
To be a teacher is to be one of the least-respected positions of authority in America and changing that is really the only way to MAGA
@nathangoldman hmmmm maybe I concur but I always thought this just meant I was from New York? And I'll fight anyone about bagels???
Likely. My school threatened something similar regarding end of the year pranks. Guess how many of the 50 participaâ€¦ https://t.co/6RVWB9Omf0
Am I a shill in thinking that people who complain that "so much great music goes undiscovered" are not paying attention??
@Noahpinion read a bit about increased construction labor/capital costs. How do we square these things up?

@eleaarose @rchlrnshw ppl are so disenfranchised with getting degrees now...I'm guessing bc they see it as little more than a transaction?
@aceckhouse oh yeah I'm with you 1000%. Would probably require a combination of RBT and light rail
@aceckhouse both issues are total black holes. Can't restrict cars bc so many lower income people rely on them to get to work
While we're on the subject of guns needing to be regulated like cars....Americans are garbage drivers. We need more restrictions there too.
@Noahpinion the only ridiculous part about them is the Olympics itselfâ€”huge waste of resources that exalts crony corruption and nationalism
@realOPJT @oakland_dem @saintexp @paulkrugman assistance =/= decided.
@JohnRossBowie @ZacharyLipez that enormous red dragon logo pairs perfectly with my job as a casino enforcer
So if I understand...the point of hockey is to talk smack ("chirp") until the other team fouls out and you score while they're down a man?
So if you had a search warrant to look for drugs and instead you found a room literally floor to ceiling with cash.â€¦ https://t.co/FDcbWuu1c5
@coreyreynoldsLA it's a great one. His version is way more within his control tho, humbled by the song. Fergie seemed to want to tackle it!
@coreyreynoldsLA i mean I've never heard a single person say they enjoy an extended rendition of the Anthem and Im sure Fergie hasn't either
@ChrisSalcedoTX @MattWalshBlog but off the court shouldn't James use his spotlight however he pleases? He owes American public nothing.

Irony of the Age of Mass Consumption is ppl pretty much all use the same stuff and can be easily reduced to one of 10 "starter pack" memes
@sophiefkemp @ZacharyLipez I don't think turning them into celebrities is going to help the cause tho, Infowars already thinks theyr puppets

@sammymaine "hi, here is our song!" and that's it. It's like an unmarked letter on your doorstep that ends up being a donation request.
The Olympics is basically the Hunger Games minus the emphasis on almost everyone getting killed. Also the outfits are next level.
Some really cool film-related things gonna be popping up in Memphis soon
This is pretty much the only color I wear https://t.co/RnQxFNghBu
@LairdBarron @jason_m_heller always amazed when people brag about not enjoying stuff
@Noahpinion also think theres contractionary forces at work as ppl realize bigger network=/=better &amp; contact info's easier to find generally
Oh yeah, that? No idea how it got in there ha.... https://t.co/qQcoXWs82r
The lamest thing about Ninja Turtles was they had deadly-ass swords but would just kick people cos kids TV couldn't show turtle slaughter
@sophiefkemp Stewart's is idyllic
So: act civil when u go to shows. Make friends. Don't be smug. Throw some high fives. And ffs book some diverse music it's the 21st century.
Namely, the importance of inclusivity and diversity, and not acting like you're more "local" than everyone else
The ppl there, many of whom go to "shows" regularly, said it was best they've felt after a gig in a while. Btw each act only played 4songs
3 acts. Magnolia, @PreauXX , and Sawyer. Compared to the 99% white indie "DIY" scene in Memphis this was 4 women, 3 POC, and 3 genres.
Tired: "nothing can be done to prevent this says only country where this ever happens"

@GalleyGreenwood as far as the song title...you see, in North America many artists actually, unironically believe in God
Bruh what the fuck https://t.co/XeFFe6hdTc
It's 2025. The North East outlaws assault weapons, sees 80% drop in school shootings. 

Florida goes w mounting guns on Boston Dynamics dogs
@somanyshrimp @alshipley disturbing the way Americans are disconnected from horrors of violence yet still see violence as a solution to it
Faith has been restored https://t.co/vqjlecOlXq
@hyperplanes @molitron @Noahpinion hopefully something more creative. Generation Alpha?...maybe we'll all speak Chinese by then anyway
@frozenreeds @geetadayal @BruceLevenstein I've got a monitor setup w/preamp but mostly just rely on one of those Bose mini thing bc it pumps
@MargeGFarrell @maxship30 looool same I listened to like 8 times and jumped to the ceiling when my boss appeared
New rule: Frank Ocean is the only person allowed to do covers
@GalleyGreenwood yeah his storytelling on Benji is brilliant. It's very humanizing

@BruceLevenstein feel like the group that rails most against genre are bands that don't want to acknowledge how neatly they fit the package

@KeiraJaneReed1 @Mulscratchy @radleybalko doubtful...we all know what they're going to say. They're ideological pundits trying to sell books
@retreats I think asserting your presence w/ unsolicited inquiries is conditioned "alpha" attitude. I know I felt pressure to be up front.
@retreats oh yeah. at uni I hosted radio and edited the paper's music pages. Most dedicated were women. Lotta dudes acting like we owed them
