Morrissey review alert! #wpinoyb http://t.co/CoCtUkk2Dx
For weeks I've been wondering how I feel about Morrissey's new album, this is what I came up with ///// http://t.co/CoCtUkk2Dx
New @sheandhim in the fall, they never cease to make delightful songs.
I'm watching a documentary on Japan's Dancehall scene, much Vice very edge.
@amy_scott93 it doesn't but it has leaked as they've been streaming it since Monday on the likes of NME.
Really feeling ultraviolence. Lana girl you done it again.
Jumping from The Beatles to Evian Christ  on my run was a strange shuffle this morning but sure why not.
Had FIDLAR and the Orwells' records spinning all week, some great new young talent in music out there. #musicisnotdead
@LHall69 yeah but he won't be the last frontman of a band to become a twat hah.
Arctic Monkeys' Snap Out of It video seems like an ego trip for Alex Turner. The girl in it is v gorgeous though.
Verdict on Lana Del Rey's new album Ultraviolence: fucking ace, seductive and powerful.
Anyone else got that 'braziiil, braziiiil, braziiiil' theme song from ITV's #WorldCup2014 coverage stuck in their heads? #bbcsportsday
Dev Hynes is undoubtedly the MJ of our generation, he’s just incredible, far too underrated https://t.co/HBNo6friFr
As a West Ham fan, Frank Lampard is a player I just love to hate, but there's no denying his goal scoring talent. #bbcsportsday
Take me back to last week at finsbury park. http://t.co/USO26xpkya
Wow can't believe the hype about St Vincent. Watching her SNL performance and its like they drained the quality out of Sky Ferreira.

Snoop Lion - Reincarnated on repeat all day and all if the night.
Just started watching Reincarnated, Snoop Dogg is such a cool character.
That new Kasabian song is a big disappointment.
But I should be heading down to Wolf Gang @ Joiners on Saturday so that should be top.
@WeLoveYouWHU Ah nice, yeah my writing has definitely come on since WLYWH as well. Yeah I know, just at the last hurdle aha.
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?
@JoeyMichaels_ Hey sorry I've sorted it for the mean time, thanks though!
@WeLoveYouWHU hey man, good to hear, might be able to contribute bits, got a lot of work over the next month ( last term of uni ever)
@josephine123x ok let me know if you know anyone needing to swap, cheers!
@josephine123x you have a Friday ticket yeah? I have a Saturday one (in post) looking to swap, you interested yeah?
@emilyaldridge12 nope it's still going, I'm looking for a Friday ticket before definitely seeing this but I shall let you know
@Sambo_Alexander YES, this still going, I need to swap my Saturday ticket for the friday!
Anyone want to change a ticket for the Saturday of Finsbury Park for the Friday? #ArcticMonkeys #twickets
New Horror track now come with edgy video, beautifully shot. 'So Now You Know' video -  http://t.co/hcyZ7wLASk
Lana Del Rey hasn't dropped a single cent of quality in new track West Coast.
Really excited to hear @devhynes' Palo Alto songs.

Sporting my Wytches tee and listening to Royal Blood, good morning!
Basically I just want to quote Morrissey in all my uni work.
Animal by @Indianathegirl is a brilliant track, have a listen https://t.co/jUk4TOXLcE
Louis Theroux's LA playlist for @BBC6Music is phenomenal, Doors, Love, Stranglers. Listen here http://t.co/TltUm5Hdns
Bit of @BBC6Breakfast before I leave, best radio station ever.
Good Morning! Got Layla and Indiana on the spin after seeing them support Bipolar Sunshine last week, two future stars!
@bipolarsunshine great show last night, I wrote a review here http://t.co/jM3bQssGU7
Bipolar Sunshine brings out the Summer vibes http://t.co/vgaDUC2OKp
Overheard someone shouting at Indiana last night "do you have soundcloud?" as if he was edgy for knowing what soundcloud is.
As Hand In Glove rings out around this famous venue the crowd are getting excited for Bipolar Sunshine.
I am human and I need to be loved...
Big shout to the joiners playlist tonight, I say playlist, I mean playing Hatful of Hollow of Smiths fame.
Bipolar Sunshine tonight at Joiners, hear some really good things so looking forward to seeing how it goes down. @bipolarsunshine

Salad Days might be even better than Rock n Roll Night Club and 2. There's an even more accomplished and polished sound to Mac's new album.
If you missed it last night, I wrote some words about Luminous, the fourth album from the Horrors, have a wee read http://t.co/xWBhS8WTeA

Review of The Horrors' upcoming LP Luminous coming in the next twenty minutes.
Right, let's review Luminous then, without just writing 'wow' 300 times!
Black Keys new track is pretty good as well, so much new music right now, can you feel the love?
Brilliant album, Mac Demarco has done it again, so calming and sweepingly beautiful. #saladdays http://t.co/ttZ5zyeXZt
First listen to Salad Days, Mac Demarco is the boy!
In the meantime check out my review of @KingCharlesUK @wearepella @CavaCavaliers &amp; @Brothergoosebg http://t.co/mENn0pNBas @solentsmilefest
The Horrors are one of those bands that make you fall in love with music all over again.
Tweens are pretty good, looking forward to hearing their whole album.
King Charles turns Southampton into Hawaii for one night only http://t.co/mENn0pNBas

Listen here to Peace's funky new track World Pleasure: http://t.co/bs6Avq08UE

Sounds like it could be straight from the 80s, Prince featuring Zooey Deschanel https://t.co/IzczAgCKst
New @horrorsofficial track tonight! On @zanelowe, so excited!
Hope there's a new Kills album out at some point, VV and Hotel are the coolest motherflippers.
Can't wait until I can finally achieve the SXSW dream in the next few years.
Horrors, Wytches and the Cribs are all on the #morningplaylist here, what about you?

Off to go interview a fellow music journalist in a bit, seems like an interesting character.
Skaters tip off their New Hat http://t.co/ScSdHNngSx
Listening to Drowners is taking me back to seeing them live, they were really bloody good.
Royal Blood are pretty good aren't they, might as well jump on the bandwagon now.
Pharrell // G I R L // Review http://t.co/IZEbptH8NE
Such nice clobber over @NFSclothing, go check them out and spend a few of your pounds.
Eddie Vedder's soundtrack for Into the Wild has got to be one of the best, what are your favourite film soundtracks/songs/scores?
I think they just used the phrase 'sexcstasy' and just wow.
Outkast will be so good at festivals this summer.
Reigniting my love for The Sonics and The Cramps this morning
