@seanisme Amy’s geography and knowledge of history and politics is a source of endless wonder for me.
@coobanpete Deeply unlucky. No earlies or lates for me. Just wall-to-wall insanes 10-5 each day.
@dorkusmalorkus_ I wouldn’t be surprised.
@tyskiesour The one on the left must be horrified to be seen in public with the rest of them.
@ellcol They’re not well, Ellen.

@dorkusmalorkus_ @ggeordiebore Stop spying on me.
Your boy just kicked someone’s leg so hard repeatedly he couldn’t put his weight on it. Love me some Sunday violence.
I’d get a curious cat but it all sounds like too much effort, so just DM me your shitty questions.
Looking forward to punching and kicking tomorrow.
