@YourScotsPast indeed!
@YourScotsPast 10 September 2017.
Our website should be live within the next couple of weeks #excitingtimesahead
@YourScotsPast We've moved to the Dewars Centre to accommodate more stallholders, will have workshops and a podcaster/vloggers lounge too...
My biggest dream this year is to grow Perth Festival of Yarn, establishing it as an annual event.  #PerthshireHour

@Art_Gems Have a great one Stella.
@CllrWilliamson @PerthandKinross We are, but sadly not as many products easily visible these days.
@SortingOffice1 @PerthandKinross @Lovetoeat11 @GBBOUK Is there any other way to have a meringue?
@Art_Gems It's getting so close now!
I have shamefully missed #PerthshireHour since moving home (almost a month ago).
