@CrackMagazine (that is, it's one of my own mixes that I'm happiest with lol, not one of my faves of 2017)

@aerielist you have to turn all the cues off first and then very carefully punch two at exactly the same time lol. Not amazing design

@aerielist one of the many things I don't really like about the 92 but got used to for the sake of the EQs
