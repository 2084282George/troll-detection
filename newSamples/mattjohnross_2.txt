Does anyone benefit more from an Islamic terrorist attack in the West than right-wing political parties?
@williamlegate @Mario_Jenkins @realDonaldTrump Also, best of luck with finding something to stop @realDonaldTrump being an embarrassment üëç
@TescoBankNews Hello! Can you give any details about when we can expect support for Android Pay? Thanks.
@AP America.
Heartbroken and ashamed of the security (and everything else) I take completely for granted. Lord, have mercy. https://t.co/TS2lHKOtEP
@MrSchmenkman @nycjayjay @GeorgeTakei If the politics of gun violence are never addressed, there will always be more shooters like him.
@f1enigma Surely Kubica would trounce Di Resta?
I have never, ever seen a movie as heavy as Lion.
@laurenafterall And what is that PB? Janet wants to run a 10k with you :)
@wtf1official Driver 1: RIC
Driver 2: HUL
Chassis: Red Bull
Power Unit: Mercedes
Boss: Vijay

Watching the faces of people as they take their seats and realise they're next to four small children is always mildly satisfying.
@BRWLTZ I hope and pray you're right re the coming change :)
@RyanAlanScott @NazResearch Thanks. That's crazy - why wouldn't they do it!? Not only would it increase participati‚Ä¶ https://t.co/dm327Ryj32
@NazResearch Will the wider assembly take NYI's lead and allow satellite sites to participate in meetings? If not, why not? #GA2017
Race of the decade? #F1
I've become a 6.30am runner. 20 year old me is laughing at 34 year old me, but 34 year old me is quite proud.
@C4F1 And by 'bad luck' you mean ineffective engine design.
@Phil_Hoy1 @mick_k86 Fingers crossed!
@nommmmmi Oh, yes please!! (apart from the one earlier which put Labour in the lead for the first time)

@mick_k86 I'm pretty sure there's no one on the planet doing more for the ISIS cause than @realDonaldTrump, king of the space cadets.

Donald Trump is a catastrophic space cadet. How is he being allowed to continue leading America? It's baffling, to say the least.
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
@wtf1official Ha! I almost forgot which day it was...
@HannahClarkson8 if I ever see this Antonio boy....
@BrianRobertson8 @mick_k86 Yep!
@lfcgregw 1. You mean Muslims. 2. That is massive, and very sad. People all over the West are grossly uninformed.
Relieved to hear early results from Dutch elections. Now, if France can keep LePen out, there's real hope for the future of Europe.
Does anyone use the Facebook messenger app and think "yeah, this app is laid out perfectly for my needs!"? I very much doubt it. #shambles
@SKODAUK Hello. Can you please tell me what size of tyres will be on the Kodiaq SEL with the 19 inch wheels? Thanks

@Ness_Edinburgh do you need to follow me so I can send you a DM?
@Ness_Edinburgh hi there, I haven't received an item I ordered and paid for at the end of Dec. Can you help? Thanks.
The writers of #sherlock are masters of suspense and intreague, but not so much of endings. #shouldhavegonetobed
@BenjiRGoodwin American Hottest from @PizzaExpress (especially when it's free with Tesco vouchers!)
@Tesco hi, thanks for coming back to me so quickly. It's the chicken stock cubes in particular.
@mick_k86 excellent stuff indeed... "Bottom line, politics is about winning.¬† The Christian has a different bottom line: love."
When Flora says she wants Donkey and Poopoo for breakfast, you know she's perfectly fine (or at least no more of a loony than usual).
First trip to A&amp;E in over 15 years of parenting. Not too bad, really. (nothing too serious) #floraruth‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7v0xfnUQsh
Nobody accompanies a plane journey quite like Nina Simone. #tweetedfromtheair
@Ryanair hello. Are you having server problems? I'm having trouble checking in on the app.
@BrianRobertson8 @AmeliaSofia @GoPro yes!! I am in love with this plan already.
@Android done now. Who will I hear back from following investigation?
Anybody coming into Perth today - Canal St multi storey is free all day :)
@allanmcnish @andrewbensonf1 @BBCSport I'm surprised anyone still cares! He lost the championship fair and square. Roll on 2017 and speeeed!
#teamNico
@BrianRobertson8 yeah, no school for me but they made me go to work instead... Booooo.
@mick_k86 we're just watching the rest of it now... brilliant stuff!

@BBC_TopGear they get the front end wrong - looks quite weak and a bit like a pastiche of a Bentley.
@Max33Verstappen You're driving without an apparent sense of reality, Max. You are the downside of the PlayStation generation.
@bequietamy only one!?! It's hardly worth it unless you get the 4 for 3 deal and eat them all yourself with a fudge doughnut for pudding :)
@C4F1 @Dany_Kvyat @ToroRossoSpy @hollysamos @karunchandhok nice of you to add 'troubled' to his job title... ha!
@BrianRobertson8 :) https://t.co/w4FRPfLwVS
@BrianRobertson8 dont know. I will make corn on the cob though. We should plan it soon and just hope for the best with the tennis.
@BrianRobertson8 we'll see :) wanna come round to mine to watch it? I'll do a BBQ.
@BrianRobertson8 nah... Sampras had everything! It was the time of the big servers, but he had more which was why he won.
Have I missed it, or have Farage and Johnson not publicly and emphatically condemned this uptick in racist and xenophobic incidents?
Not a good sign. We who oppose must surely love louder than ever! https://t.co/GparKKUBdF
Gotta love slow walkers at the airport (because Jesus says to, otherwise there is no other reason).
Hey Duggee is great for lots of different reasons. I think it's even better than Peppa Pig. #controversial
@virginmedia hi, do you know of any service issues in Perth, Scotland? Internet hasn't been connected for about 4 hours.
#comeonDing!
@F1icom yes please (by championship points order)!
@GrandPrixDiary (cont'd) It'd be great for racing/overtaking and would probably produce a much better spread of points between teams.
