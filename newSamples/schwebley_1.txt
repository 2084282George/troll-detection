Tried to de-moustache myself using Veet face waxing strips naively believing they wouldn't rip a layer of skin off again. Grievous error.
I'm very pleased that whilst I've been out and about today I've heard the Smashing Pumpkins playing in the background twice.
Excited to learn there's a massive Asda close to where I live, disappointed that it involves trekking through industrial wasteland &amp; hills.
Me @ 2am: I should really try to sleep right now. 
Also me @ 2am: I really need to know all I can about the comet that killed the dinosaurs
How's my grad job hunt going? Well I sent off an application and realised I called the hiring manager Ms Salami instead of Ms Saleemi.
Requested a Friday night off work which means I'm sitting alone on my sofa reading the Wikipedia page for the characters from the Muppets.
Admittedly photo on the top left is my own dog and is thus staged due to lack of relevant in vans material at the time.
An old white man attempted to give me and anti abortion leaflet yesterday. Declined but wish I'd told him "no uterus no opinion" instead.
La Femme D'argent by Air sounds like it should soundtrack an M&amp;S advert.
My approach to housework: swept and mopped the entirety of my flat and had had to have three lie downs intermittently during it.
Almost 9 years old but still my puppy. https://t.co/n3O8hOnCJS
Best Thursday! Today I went out for brunch, drank irn-bru, had a nap, ate two curries &amp; nailed the Duchess pub quiz with @missdamiller.
Agreeing with a compliment from a man and seeing his reaction is the most entertaining game there is.

About to go on my first fam holiday in 7 years tomorrow. Living on boat for a week in 35 degree heat &amp; I hope we don't kill one another.
If you're not angry then you should be.
Is it the ultimate goal of the #DailyMail to be as obnoxious, insulting and offensive (to put it lightly) as possible at any given moment?
Reflecting on how bad my gym habits have become as they've managed to construct beside what looks like a 12 storey building in my absence.
I am troubled by the realisation that kids who were born the year I took my Highers are going to high school after the summer.
It's all fun n games eating Chinese food in bed until you realise warm sweet n sour sauce has spilt and poured all down your pjs and duvet.

I don't think anything will make me happier this year than JC becoming PM.

Tripped and fell over a flattened wire fence in the woods and scraped my knees earlier. The agony! To think we did that all the time as kids

The Waverley mall in Edinburgh has it's own piano player for the food court, just slap bang between KFC and McDonald's. Blimey.
