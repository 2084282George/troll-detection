@RealMarkLatham @australian CPAC 2017 wouldn't have him either, was that because of ancient middle eastern rivalries? Stop being silly.
Don Burke is a disgrace. #DonBurke https://t.co/162U9A5I8e
@Kate_McClymont Don Burke 'coming out' as Aspergers is like Kevin Spacey coming out as gay to excuse pedophilia. Cynical and irrelevant.
@TheOnion not funny, boo 😒
@ssofay or when you're starting out &amp; they come over to 'give advice', try to adjust eqs &amp; filters &amp; come on to you all at same time? Ugh.
@Belairviv Irrelevant and misogynist. Right is right, wrong is wrong. Period.
YES!!!!! Yay Australia! #marriageequaility 🌈🌈🌈
@tjfoxx_ @dinahskarma I'm not, was in Koh Pha Nang in the 1990's in a beach village an 1hr by boat from only big town. No spray tans there!
@tjfoxx_ @dinahskarma more specifically German &amp; British going on accent &amp; as I said nearly black as in the colour from a LOT of sun.
@kimrichardsaa @LydiaSnider @KevinSpacey so over indulgence and drunkeness nullifies predatory behaviour? That IS a textbook excuse! Irony!
@screenjunkies extremely disappointing, won't be watching until this matter is resolved.
@michellevisage @MarcBouwer @bitter4Britney you look AMAZING 👑👑👑❤️
@5thEstateShow @jonfavs @ComfortablySmug I'm Australian so not dem, but left leaning and listen to many right leaning pods. I like variety.
@jpodhoretz yes, but her pettiness and downright stupidity doesn't play dramatically for the screen. Banality of evil's too boring for most.
@BaldMove if the double ds' were pissed with grrm, what if they were passive aggressively taking it out on Sam by making him do dumb things?
@jpodhoretz levelling up from crushing morosity?
@youngmallgrab congratulations
@ILoveMikePence1 @danielkrby @willcarless @bakedalaska it's his job, he makes bank off it, plus gets notoriety. He's basically a Kardasian.
@mixtapekevin young life choices
@BretEastonEllis to aggravate your bf?
@SonnyBunch I have also seen g-force at the cinema. Good pick but having seen smurfs 3 not once but twice this year, i believe it's worse.
@BaldMove hot take for ya. Ep 1 contrasts 3 different Stark takes on justice, Jon (lawful) Sansa (political) Arya (bloody revenge). Discuss!
@michellevisage @EwaWladymiruk too cute.
@danpolyak sure, but a 'what about X tho' defence doesn't address the actual issue. Hypocrisy is bad but it's not the point.
@Ripperton featuring evil mastermind shut-in with peroxide blonde hair with love interest played by Pamela Anderson?
@realDonaldTrump vile.
@shotwithsoju was a Shea &amp; Trinity fan, but Sasha's looks &amp; lipsyncing were undeniable. Format &amp; winner always has been Ru's choice alone 💯
@sethtroxler @ambivalent @djRebekah exsqueeze me? I am a woman and also know a lot of women who don't 'just like urban music more', wtf?
@krissyistormy @ccoastgirl @PaulineHansonOz I hear you. I support tailored ed for asd kids, be it in a special unit, MS class or a mix.
@krissyistormy @ccoastgirl @PaulineHansonOz I have 3 in my family so I can speak on this and I disagree with you. It's a spectrum!
@aussiegirl114 @PaulineHansonOz Kids with issues that impact learning DO get this specialised help WITHIN the MS classroom from SLSOs 🤔
@thailandscams @billshortenmp @AustralianLabor @PaulineHansonOz oh really? And what pray tell qualifies you to make that judgement?
@ajaqueen seriously I would have watched all S9 just to hear 'I didn't read her, I aggressively complimented her' 🙌
@isshehungry I just did too actually, for the same reason, but now I'm here I'll stay for your party 😉
@shotwithsoju yes but only ru alone can make the final decision, it's an intrinsic part of RPDR
@mtracey @rachel_handler not by any dictionary I know of.
@mtracey @roybragg she clearly did not
@benshapiro @metpoliceuk law enforcement apparently shot dead the perpetrators in less than 10 mins from first report. Not that ridiculous 🤔
#ripcovfefe
Alexis Michelle has all my love, she's doing her thing. It's a tv competition show people, get a grip! #alexismichelle
@TrinityTheTuck I am on tenterhooks to see your club kid look. Love you 😽😽😽
@AlrightMary @SFCHpodcast it's the proverbial elephant on the runway this season. What is going on??? I want her to look her best for VH1 😟
@blucu @BuslifeRecords shade!
@SFCHpodcast for your Aussie squirellfriends season 9 is showing on Stan, same day as US 😜 Xx
Q. For the pod. When Romney said Russia was greatest enemy in 12 was he right? Want you to address this. @jonlovett @jonfavs @TVietor08
@BenPearceDJ if you're into a bit of Brit medieval history check out @donaeldunready for some classic trumpian satire #makemerciagreatagain
@AlrightMary You are 16 going on 17 now (well 20 actually 😏) Loving the podcast!
@DJDannyHoward @dominos Please. 1st world problems.
@dassalo clearly a vip
One of the best. Finally some good news for 2016 🔊♥️ https://t.co/iA5qbgkhr1
@EricKleefeld I raise you W.L.Shirer's Rise &amp; Fall of the 3rd Reich. Downloaded last week for light relief. 20 hrs down, 36 to go.
Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen - Winston Churchill. #BoycottHamilton
@UniqloUSA love the carine roitfeld collection. Can I order any pieces online from Australia?
Queen Katya 👑 #TeamKatya #AllStars2
@Javi_NYCTechno @ZHIIING but something a bit off putting about girls being singled out. Plenty of dudes up there annoying me when I play 😏
@RuPaul 👑👑👑
Terrible decision for London, culture, creativity. One of the all time greats gone #fabriclondon
