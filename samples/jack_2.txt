Great from Ray. And also see the convo on this tweet https://t.co/oL2ftpl4Ld

We‚Äôre committing to significantly increasing transparency for all ads on Twitter, especially political and issue ad‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7aloLYutgZ

We wanted to explain why policy changes take time. There‚Äôs always ways to improve, but here‚Äôs where we are today: https://t.co/R1dkiqhZWk

We just decided to share our internal safety work streams &amp; shipping calendar tomorrow (10/19). This makes us feel‚Ä¶ https://t.co/KOAnXX8oCa

Will keep this thread updated with our progress. We‚Äôre doing a daily meeting to ensure more urgency

@monteiro @JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel Never asked for credit Mike

@davewiner Listened to it all. Doesn‚Äôt mean we are going to implement everything! ;)

@davewiner Come on. This isn‚Äôt true. We care. We have to build a business to fund the service

@yaelwrites @JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel @jilliancyork True and we are considering our policies here

@yaelwrites @JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel @jilliancyork We don‚Äôt allow posting private phone numbers or information

@jilliancyork ? We engage with all that want to

@jilliancyork Definitely not true. See the membership of our Trust and Safety Council

@bloggerheads No

@janemerrick23 @EricMarkowitz Wish is was that easy. We are working to solve this systemically.  Not one off.

@yaelwrites @_Anunnery @jilliancyork I wish they wouldn‚Äôt do this but arrest records are public and include this level of detail.

@jilliancyork @yaelwrites @censored Send these reports

@jilliancyork @yaelwrites Yes

@yonatanzunger We‚Äôre on it!

@tprstly Not yet. Machine learning alone will not solve our problems.

@mor10 Thanks

@EricMarkowitz Will work on it

@Blackamazon I‚Äôll match

@Blackamazon Answering now. Apologies for delay. We‚Äôre trying to scale as fast as we can

@alexeheath That‚Äôs our objective! Open, consistent, and real time.

@lasersushi We recognized we weren‚Äôt enforcing as we need to. Fixing

@RMac18 What‚Äôs blocking you?

@alexeheath The time doesn‚Äôt matter, just that it happens

@jandawson Agree

7/ New rules around: unwanted sexual advances, non-consensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorifies violence.

5/ We‚Äôve been working intensely over the past few months and focused today on making some critical decisions.

3/ In 2017 we made it our top priority and made a lot of progress.

1/ We see voices being silenced on Twitter every day. We‚Äôve been working to counteract this for the past 2 years.

@zenxv Important they get it out of their system

@travisbedard @JamesComtois @Twitter We‚Äôre trying to address in-between that: people not saying anything from frustration of either.

@FutureBoy Yeah. People will still self edit. And having a bit more room to get out of superficial headline takes w‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mJmK2YC0BZ

@FutureBoy Just retweeted one. Also: most tweets won‚Äôt even get close to 280. Likely 160-180. Average today is 35.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/gvQNbp6EYI

Yes this is clever https://t.co/W49VwRkLIX

This is a small change, but a big move for us. 140 was an arbitrary choice based on the 160 character SMS limit. Pr‚Ä¶ https://t.co/tYHA2VTS5l
