We‚Äôve identified gaps here too. Consistent interpretation and enforcement of our rules is our objective. We also ne‚Ä¶ https://t.co/5zZSYkxmJw

@cwarzel @JohnPaczkowski Will keep everyone updated on the original thread

@davewiner @realDonaldTrump Also not true. It‚Äôs a moment in time

@yaelwrites @JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel @jilliancyork Never said that. We are considering. Need to prioritize.

@yaelwrites @JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel @jilliancyork No that‚Äôs not true. We don‚Äôt allow doxing. PD is pusblishing according to sunshine laws

@yaelwrites @JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel Replied to you in other thread. Sunshine laws for arrests

@JohnPaczkowski @cwarzel I didn‚Äôt say we solved it. But we did make progress (which Charlie has also reported on)

@ErinBlaskie We‚Äôre def considering how to enable that @paraga

@zenxv We‚Äòre considering what more ‚Äúcrowdsourcing‚Äù would look like @paraga

@jilliancyork Right. It‚Äôs a balance.

@chrischameleon Glorify. You got the point I think?

@yaelwrites @jilliancyork @_Anunnery We aren‚Äôt

@jilliancyork @yaelwrites @_Anunnery We know. Considering. Came up in our all-hands today.

@jilliancyork @yaelwrites @censored How?

@jilliancyork @yaelwrites We apply it to everyone. It‚Äôs mostly been effective

@SophiaCannon We want to amplify the former and diminish the latter

@yaelwrites We haven‚Äôt. She sent a tweet containing someone‚Äôs private information. We temp suspended the account un‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ENcD8bqn0X

@EricMarkowitz Thanks!

@thomasfuchs @biz Yes. Not asking for anything before

@tprstly We have them. Matter of focus.

@EricMarkowitz Enforcing according to our rules comes first. Will get to it as soon as we can, but we have limited‚Ä¶ https://t.co/4MvCYvFpVC

@EricMarkowitz We‚Äôre reconsidering our verification policies. Not as high a priority as enforcement, but it‚Äôs up there

@alexeheath We want to communicate actions in real time. That‚Äôs what we were among for

@alexeheath Day doesn‚Äôt matter. We spoke when we had something to say.

@Shakti_Shetty Boo

@RMac18 Because we spent the whole day working on it and wanted to announce as soon as we were ready

8/ These changes will start rolling out in the next few weeks. More to share next week.

6/ We decided to take a more aggressive stance in our rules and how we enforce them.

4/ Today we saw voices silencing themselves and voices speaking out because we‚Äôre *still* not doing enough.

2/ We prioritized this in 2016. We updated our policies and increased the size of our teams. It wasn‚Äôt enough.

@1FightingIrish @Kantrowitz @rosemcgowan @realDonaldTrump I believe he read the number aloud during a public appperance, not on Twitter

@JasonCross00 We do need to do a better job at showing that we are not selectively applying rules.

üëáüèº thread. We need to be a lot more transparent in our actions in order to build trust. https://t.co/7T6aliOXmG

@leslieberland @SevenWorkouts @WillStick Did you have 7 minutes?

The Square api now supports Apple Pay https://t.co/JcC9F1eRxR

@zenxv If people only did that, then yes: terrible!

@PandianAMS @FutureBoy Yeah we‚Äôre going to share our results @mrdonut

@PandianAMS @FutureBoy Don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs the text that‚Äôs charming, not the length

@sriramk @aarthir I‚Äôd say he needs to speak more about some things, less about others (WWE, LeBron)

@pbump ‚Ä¶

@sarahkunst @alicegoldfuss We‚Äôre still working on it Sarah

@GlennF We‚Äôre doing better. Lots of work ahead

@ItsAlfieGreen We are focused on that and have made a lot of progress

@chrissyteigen We‚Äôre working hard so you love it more! We won‚Äôt fail you!

@tomcoates I know! And it‚Äôs appreciated. That‚Äôs part of the learning

@jendudley Happens

@deray It will be. Give it some time

@KurtWagner8 Yes. That‚Äôs my mom

And most won‚Äôt! Probably average out just above 140. But we‚Äôll see! #280characters https://t.co/82ncCdN8dA

@chrissyteigen You can still hold yourself to 140

Spot on. Always been the story of this service https://t.co/gZWHbfPpSu

@AnthonyQuintano Which ones?

@MicahSingleton No, that‚Äôs not a concern
