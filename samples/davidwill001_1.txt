@xbrooklynite21 @rudeabaker @FoxNews @POTUS I won't be trusting 45, or your shitty daddy issues.

@thehill We know but it's still good to see people who have influence call out the dotard. #Resist

@washingtonpost He's screwing over a large portion of his base, and they will still find blame elsewhere. The daddyâ€¦ https://t.co/TcRGhcRSgp

@axios He can fool the morons, but he can't fool the resistance. He's a lying piece of fucking shit right here. #Resist

RIP You sweet man. https://t.co/ALq7ewaeJj

@DearAuntCrabby This guy has no character, or self awareness to even discover such things. What a hoot! Sad!

Everybody needs to know who @KyleKulinski is. Please watch and support his show Secular Talk. https://t.co/RtlS3EA1p4

If Trump can shoot someone in the middle of 5th Ave, then stripping away health care from the poorest of his base won't be an issue. #Resist

As long as Trump supporters get to feel right about something it doesn't matter to them if they are actually wrong. #Resistance @Impeach_D_

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I just wish the people of PR stood with our President as he is the true victim of this hurricane.

@mcspocky But most of all he truly hates himself, believe me. He hates himself bigly.

Trump supporters will dismiss 45's Anti-First Amendment rhetoric, because they are in a cult.  @Impeach_D_Trump @KeithOlbermann

@tfcocs This is me imagining how they think. This is me getting inside their heads. I want out!

@laurenarankin Imagine the scumbag lawyer who defended him. True human scum does exist in human form.

Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment of women was just locker room behavior. #TrumpLogic @Impeach_D_Trump @KyleKulinski @youngturksrec

If Mike Ditka could stick to football, and steaks that would be great.

@pattymo Spooked me! https://t.co/Ux32ZVho6W

@thehill It's like a VP opposing free speech could be seen as bad for America, or something. The optics on this are fucking horrible!

Why can't you all see that Trump is the real victim of Hurricane Maria here?

@KeithOlbermann Trump is so humble!

@thehill Well, this is certainly news that Trump's administration is a heartless piece of shit. Yep, this just in.

Is Jeff Sessions satire?

I'm not religious but I've started praying to Robert Mueller here.

@wastedtime01 @peterdaou What's with you and men's dongs, bro? Rhetorical question, sweety, but Uncle Bernie was robbed, and you know it!

I see @TheOnion ran a funny article about Trump dedicating a trophy to Puerto Rico. You guys still got it!

@thehill Yes, Trump is dumber than you think he is. It's almost like he doesn't think things through, or something.

@nytimes She's a woman and this is where Trump has a problem with her.

These two right here! I love 'em! https://t.co/u0Q3krqHQt

@KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump He's such a control freak. I hope everybody takes a knee tomorrow.

Gonna have a drink of water, big water, tap water.

As a country how bad are our daddy issues? ðŸ¤”
