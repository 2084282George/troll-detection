@Espngreeny it's selfish but I agree. I don't think anyone would out right admit it but behind closed doors they would feel the same way

@Tim_Diddy check @soblessedb4 on Instagram

@OfficialBraylon so glad to see u back in green. U definitely were one of my favorite players on the team a few years ago. Time to ball out!

@racheltnelson negotiations for our contract were absurd and instead of keeping us working they locked us out and have mngrs doing our jobs
